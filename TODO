TODO list for M   
$Id$

- fix configure: it currently depends on the right order of with-wxGTK/without-wxXt

- check how Python handles (wx)Strings, try some interaction

- move to kbList

- doc++ dumps core when generating documentation

- there is still a minor problem with URLs ending in > like <http:xxx>
  Ignored for now, until wxFText/wxFTCanvas get rewritten.

- paths for PATH and PYTHONPATH get set wrongly in MApplication::OnInit(), why?

- for now, internal scripts directly execute the code passed as the
  function, this may be changed to loading it from outside. Also,
  namespace issues need to be sorted out. 

- Script.cc: no input/output redirection for Windows, don't know how to do this.
