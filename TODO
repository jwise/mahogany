TODO list for M   
$Id$

*** bugs to fix ***
- MessageView:
  + extraction of parameter list and filenames for mime handling/saving
  + fix size an parent relationships
  + some code in wxMessageView relies on unix unlink() behaviour 
    (file is still open and in use when deleted)
  + wxMessageView : Profile reading causes segfault, marked with FIXME
  + fix profile mess in here, use folder profile and MessageView profile
  + ADD FORWARD AND REPLY, using wxFolderView functionality

- ComposeView:
   + extra header lines don't get set, why? Profile bug?

- wxLayout:
  + fix my printing code in wxl*.new in src/Projects/wxLayout
  + backspace sometimes goes wrong, occasional editing problems
  + flicker

- parent frames should not be NULL in dialogs
  (does not happen when run in gdb)

- WINDOWS: how to do MIME handling?

- clean up header inclusion: use <> for system/wxWin files and "xxx" for M
  headers in order to get "make depend" right

- fix non-ASCII characters in header lines

- Python
  + in src/Python: improve rules to always redo .cpp/.py
  + drop Script classes
  + add remaining (important) interface definitions
  + add an InputBox dialog
  + user/global Minit files, security issues
  + add documentation to installation target

*** to implement in near future ***

- cut and paste for wxllist, wxhtmlwindow, wxHtmlImport()

- when run for the first time, should display "Mail" configuration dialog
  with reasonable defaults (add a top-level profile option "ConfigDone"
  and do it if it's not found) including import of XFace from file

- lots of dialogs for profile settings required

- support for external editor (WHAT!? KB)

*** long-term projects ***

- Support for different charsets (Unicode/utf-7/8?)

- LDAP -- possibly using python ldap module?

- automatic (but optional) mail compactification (to save disk space)?
  -> this could be done using scripts?

- creation of separate index files for mail folders

- wxWindow position not updated when frame is moved (wxGTK)
- drawing of transparent icons on wxDC gives undefined background (wxGTK)
