TODO list for M

*** bugs to fix ***
- MessageView:
  + better detection of mime type for inlining graphics
  + extraction of parameter list and filenames for mime handling/saving
  + move wxMessageView to be a panel only and rewrite folderview
  + some code in wxMessageView relies on unix unlink() behavious (file is still open and
    in use when deleted)
  + wxMessageView : Profile reading causes segfault, marked with FIXME
  + fix profile mess in here, use folder profile and MessageView profile

- fix my printing code in wxl*.new in src/Projects/wxLayout

- clean up header inclusion: use <> for system/wxWin files and "xxx" for M
  headers in order to get "make depend" right

- occasional segfaults on exit (but also in GNOME :-)

- there is still a minor problem with URLs ending in > like <http:xxx>
  Ignored for now, until wxFText/wxFTCanvas get rewritten.

- drop Script classes
- for now, internal scripts directly execute the code passed as the
  function, this may be changed to loading it from outside. Also,
  namespace issues need to be sorted out. 

- Script.cc: no input/output redirection for Windows, don't know how to do this.
  (VZ: it's probably also (will be) needed in other places: think about
  running external viewers for attachments &c?)

- fix non-ASCII characters in header lines

- in src/Python: improve rules to always redo .cpp/.py

- In wxMessageView::MimeHandle is a call to wxRemoveFile(). This
  relies on the Unix behaviour of a file continuing to exist after its
  deletion for as long as it is still in use. Does this work for Windows?
*** to implement in near future ***

- when run for the first time, should display "Mail" configuration dialog
  with reasonable defaults (add a top-level profile option "ConfigDone"
  and do it if it's not found)

- lots of dialogs for profile settings required

- support for external editor

*** long-term projects ***

- Support for different charsets (Unicode/utf-7/8?)

- LDAP

- automatic (but optional) mail compactification (to save disk space)?
  -> this could be done using scripts?

- creation of separate index files for mail folders
