*********************************************************************
*** Suspicious, to be tested:
*********************************************************************

 - on Alpha: no XFace inserted, trying to convert ~/.xface to ~/.xface.xpm although already an Xpm
 -  new mail dialog getting stuck?
 - mAppBase::OnExit() gets called twice
 - creating new folder and immediately after doing a message/copy to
   folder caused crash
 - sometimes M is very slow sending a message, why?
 - when calling netscape to view URL, M locked up (after writing
   "done"), top showed two M processes and after a while it terminated
   with an IO trap 

*********************************************************************
*** not fixed yet:
*********************************************************************
- make wxFolderView::Update() a bit more intelligent. Clicking on
  unread mails changes the flags and therefore resets selection.
- speed up copy mail to folder by cusing c-client functionality
- add some more folder properties to config dialog, i.e. be able to
  switch off automatic notification of incoming emails.
  Currently, coying emails to another folder produces "New Mail" dialogs.
- fix my OpenAnyFolderDialog to take hostname and folderpath, as
  required for imap  --> drop the dialog?
 - wxListCtrl selection gets reset if message has to be fetched, if it 
   was already clicked on once, it won't reset the
   selection. Apparently fetching a message resets the listctrl. Maybe  
   some c-client update event?

 - forwarding messages broken, no content
 - sending messages takes ages - why? Vadim: can you do some profiling
   on that?  --> Local network problem? Verify again later.
 - investigate problem of empty message bodies (e.g. on Micky's mails
   from the Scottish Office).
 - POP3: loading all message contents(why?) and twice(why?)
 - ADB: does not use substring??? (Joen_Doedoe no expansion for
   "doe" or "Doe")
 - folderview listctrl has extra Subject column behind Size field ???
 - wxlwindow: MIME menu appears at wrong position again
 - when inserting filetype of unknown MIME type, prompt for it,
   possibly have a MIME types editor (similar to netscape's?)
 - forward messsages as 7Bit, i.e. provide 7bit/8bit selection in
   SendMessageCC::AddPart()

 - make Message class use reference counting !
 - new mail dialog:
   + sometimes From: is empty
   + if more than one new mail, info for one of them is duplicated
   + apparently if mails have been deleted in the meantime, counter
     must be updated

 - wxLayout:
   + printing needs better scaling how does sample do it?
   + use smaller fonts for printing.
   \--> works well like now, but setting the printer scale smaller
        reduces page size, just rescale fonts instead
 - wxLayout:
  + Refresh!!
  + undo?
  + fix the minor (moving up in 1st column over empty line) bug

 - integrate new c-client lib 4.5
 - save and restore printer settings in profile
 - M takes ages to send a message
 - add a wxASSERT() for the correct path in READ_APPCONFIG()
 - add some progress messages when opening folders (looks like it's
   hung when accessing POP folders)
 - Profile readEntry() needs interface extension to allow a boolean success
   value, remove hacks like 17 or "illegal value"!

 - trying to exit M when wxMessageViews are open doesn't work and MObjects get
   leaked
 - Memory leaks whenever using wxMessageView (there are some from cclient)
 - add remaining translation strings from include files
 - handle "truncated mailfolder" more gracefully (i.e. close and re-open folder)
   VZ: when 2 mail clients are running simultaneously and the message is deleted
       from the spool M crashes with meaningless backtrace.
       Didn't happen to me but c-client produced an error message and deactivated
       the mail stream.

 - document scripts in extra/scripts

 - move some functionality from wxFolderView to MailFolder?

 
 - Profile fixes/rewrite:
   - Current wxFolderView::SaveMessages() relies on
     MailFolder::OpenFolder() profile/file behaviour 


 - somehow allow different configs for different hosts, maybe a
   [M/HOSTNAME/Profiles] section overriding [M/Profiles]?

 - OptionsPanels:
   -add a help button which calls a help id depending on which page we're on
   - confirm exit button does have no effect and should be Yes No Ask
     Radiobox anyway

 - GUI problems:
  - configuration panels way too large!
  - log window occasionally doesn't layout menu correctly (here too, no idea)
  - replace the ugly "Insert File" icon with one looking more like the 
    other icons
  - folder tree control should (configurable on a per-folder basis)
    highlight and count the number of new messages
  - add (simple) keyboard interface to folder view (?)
    (at least d,n,p or something like that)

- ADB:
  + make AdbEdit auto-generate a formatted name from first/family-name
    and prefix/title. 
  + for names without entries, use the same method for name generation 
    as ProvBBDB for consistency
  + config entry names should allow  ',' (needed for mail names which
    might contain it, just received one from "john doe, archeology"),
    the same for apostrophes  
  + autocollect.adb should be flushed as soon as it is created to allow
    opening it from the editor
  + add "add current address to ADB" to compose view
  + should be updated when new entries are created (can't be deleted from
    elsewhere for now...), add an event for this
  - can't open autocollect.adb in AdbEditor if already opened (can't reproduce
    any more)
  - ADB: does not use substring??? (Joen_Doe no expansion for
    "doe" or "Doe")
  - closing adb editor while entries are selected somewhere (at least
    in bbdb) causes error messages when opened the next time because
    it cannot select the entry again
  - copying between address books and groups
  - BBDB: sort entries by surname
  - easy: add support for email-to-fax gateway at www.tpc.int and
    their coverpage
  - add "Inline" option for MIME popup on graphics

(Windows)
 - list ctrl resizing columns doesn't propagate the event to the app
 - memory leaks (run Purify on it)
 - options dlg layout looks ugly (radiobox is way too big)
 - in folder create/properties dialog there is missing UpdateUI() right
   after creation - add it somewhere
 - lock file checking for INBOX:
   + it does locking under Windows too, but the lock file names are different
     Testing for FOLDER.lock* now, is that fine?


*********************************************************************
*** things to fix/implement next ***
*********************************************************************

- wxPNotebook doesn't restore the page sometimes, why?

- wxFolderCreateNotebook should be split into base class and 2 derivations:
  wxFolderCreateNotebook and wxFolderPropNotebook

- put number of total/unread/new msgs in the status bar for the selected
  folder in wxMainFrame, also draw the folders with the new mail in bold

- could we have each flag at its own position in folder view listview? I.e.
  now they all appear in sequence and I'd like each of them have its own
  position (looks better and it becomes easier to spot, for example, all
  unread messages)

- folder set message flag update hook takes too long for really large folders
==> code commented out in MailFolderCC.cpp

- easy to implement but useful features:
  - "check for new mail now"

- Are wxConfig/Profile GetNextGroup()/GetFirstGroup()  thread-safe??
  I started marking possible problems for multi-threaded code with
  //FIXME:MT
  VZ: ok, I usually do it too (always) except for the "obvious" problems, e.g.
      usage of static vars. I always name them with "s_" prefix (for this
      reason too) so it should be quite easy to do a grep for them later
  - MT-problem: rfc822_extraheaders()

- add "Send Digest"

- wxLayout:
  + cut&paste, different cursor for focus/no focus
  + DragNDrop (waiting for GNOME 1.0 / Debian Slink)

- integrate new IMAP c-client library CAREFUL: rfc822.c has changed, old patch no longer
  valid:
   This is the new code for rfc822_extraheader_lines:

	void rfc822_extraheader_lines (char **header,ENVELOPE *env)
	{
	   char **names = rfc822_extraheader_names;
	   char **values = rfc822_extraheader_values;
	   while(names && *names)
	   {
	      if (values) sprintf ((*header += strlen (*header)),"%s%s: %s\015\012",
				 env->remail ? "ReSent-" : "",
				 *(names++),
				 *(values++)
				 );
	   }
	}


- KEYBOARD BINDINGS AND TAB TRAVERSAL (!!IMPORTANT!!)

- add !(command) expansion to wxConfig, i.e.
  VAR=!(hostname):me would execute "hostname" and return "hydra.medieval.de:me"

- reply/forward buttons for messageview/folderview
- only quote the selected text in reply/forward if there is any selection
  (as in XFMail) - very handy
- update FolderView if mailbox has shrunk  (which callback gets called?)

- look into wxListCtrl reset after dialog box popup

- rearrange some preferences pages, distinguish between compose options
  and compose window layout (BCC label etc)

- Add the real folder create panel to the folder create notebook

- DND with gmc (dead easy, see dnd example :-) )


- announce M on bbdb mailing list

  + add Picture field to Adb
    VZ: what should it contain? a file name? ...let's do this later
  + implement "internal clipboard" for
    - cut-&-paste
    - drag-&-drop

  + some fields are sometimes created disabled under Windows - very mysterious...

- UI things
  + we should somehow merge the toolbars into the main frame toolbar if it
    shows the folder view, for example
  + session management

- Python
  + fix Python problems -- what's wrong? No idea why Setup.py doesn't work.
  + add remaining (important) interface definitions
  + user/global Minit files, security issues
  + add OnNewMail callback by counting messages in mailbox
    + add sample callback showing new messages
  + merge in wxPython

- find a way to run stripwxhelpids from Manual automatically
- merge text parts into one, send non-MIME mail


*** to implement in near future ***

- event subsystem
  + write some macros for safe casting of the event param in the handlers to
    the correct type
  + separate "folder tree change" event in "pre" and "post" kind
  + may be introduce return values?

- news reader functions
  + get the list of newsgroup and allow to choose from them
  + propose to get only some articles when there are more than some number of
    them (opening a never-read newsgroup takes _ages_)
  + "catch up" command
  + filtering of cross posted articles - would be very nice if this could be
    also used to filter the copies of received mail messages (i.e. if a
    message is sent to the mailing list and cc'd to me I'd like to read it
    only once)

- wxFolderView assumes that msg numbers are 1...n - change this to use uids instead.

- Use configure to check for utilities, like help browser. "ReConfigure" menu.

- Edit-CC, CC messages to others but edit the individual copies before sending

- SendMessageCC should derive from a SendMessage abc

- threading of messages via MessageId/References header lines
  Follow examples in SunExpert journal.

- compressed mail folders

- "Power Search": search all (even compressed?) folders for a keyword
  and when found, open the folder and display the message.

- Export and import of addressbook in text format.
  I'd like a feature to select fields from the addressbook and write
  them, e.g. semicolon separated as a list to a file, so one could
  parse them in scripts or whatever else.

- fix non-ASCII characters in header lines

- if message contains only text, don't create MIME multipart message

- REMOTE-CONTROL: add support for popping window open and reading a folder of one's choice
  (for being controlled from xbiff like programs)
  idea: listen() on a socket and write socket number to a file ~/.M/socket

********************* long-term projects ***********************

- Support for different charsets (Unicode/utf-7/8?)

- LDAP -- possibly using python ldap module or OpenLDAP.

- automatic (but optional) mail compactification (to save disk space)?
  -> this could be done using scripts?

- creation of separate index files for mail folders

********************* targets for re-write **********************

MailFolder::OpenFolder() are so confusing (login for NNTP is the newsgroup!!)
that even you apparently forget what is what - let's call the newsgroup
parameter "newsgroup" even if we will have unused parameters for each call...

Clean up MailFolder/Message classes as part of header/class rewrite
for modularisation. Share common code in
MessageCC/MailFolderCC/SendMessageCC and somehow integrate SendMessage
classes in the hierarchy.

- !!! non-blocking message retrieval !!!

********************* known wxWindows bugs **********************

- font mess (wxGTK)
- constraints
  - Ian Galbraith complained about being unable to enter anything into
    the compose view (all wxTextCtrls in wxFrames instead of dialogs under
    OpenLook WM)  --> wxGTK bug, ignore it!

- wxMemoryDC and Blit() cannot handle non-(0,0) viewports

*********************************************************************
*** Fixed, to be tested:
*********************************************************************
 - make Message use refcount
 - sometimes mailfolders/messages seem empty
 - add message/move to folder


*********************************************************************
*** Fixed and tested:
*********************************************************************
 - copying to other folder only writes headers, no content 
 - allow '=' in urls and don't allow ' '
 - help fails to find copyright
 - .mo files should be found in M_BASEDIR/locale
 - toolbars need to be a bit higher
 - crash when switching off header display in messageview
 - forwarding message triggers assert in wxComposeView:119
 - password entry field needs to use password setting to hide text
 - add explaining texts to python dialog
 - Toolbar sizes are wrong. --> used ugly workaround in
                                wxMainFrame.cpp which works most of the time
                                Robert is aware of this.
 - set permissions for config files (passwords!) (This is done in Profile.cpp now
   but should really be in wxConfig code)
 - SentMessages folder sometimes looked up in wrong directory (seems ok)
 - SentMail folder looked up in wrong directory still and gets
   overwritten instead of appended to
 - funny: X-Face/X-Mailer headers get sent but don't appear in SentMail folder.
 - BBDB file format in read-only mode seems to work, needs a bit more
   testing, crashes are gone
 - BBDB save on exit, and parsing it in again
 - BBDB miniframe needs parent and text needs to move down
 - add explaining texts configuration panel  (return address, hostname)
 - add Statusbar to wxMessageView
 - ADB: warnings when opening BBDB, about missing entries
 - ADB: file format looks strange, all entries have absolute paths,
   although within the AdbEntries group
 - deleting message ("Messsage|Delete") doesn't work
 - configuration panel got stuck on Solaris (usual constraints problem,
   goes away after resizing) -- (VZ) it happens to me under Linux too sometimes
   (occasional wxGTK bug?)
 - new "new mail" message seems to show wrong number
 - user name no longer contains additional fields
 - wxAboutDialog:
   + has extra wxYield() to improve display at startup
   + scrollbars should disappear now
 - deleting messages from wxMessageView doesn't work
 - wxLayout:
   + "Home" key is funny  (fixed)
   + some other keys are funny, too, ignore control characters
   + flicker is gone, scrollbars are fine
   + some more keyboard bindings (ctrl-u/k)
   + make it have a border (easy via offset!)
   + scrollbar settings  .. work perfectly fine for me
   + Delete() in wxLayoutList is broken (ctrl-y triggers it)
   + cursor corrupts last character
 - MFrame icon not found, compile it in. (lowercase?!)
 - strange lyx/latex problems (caused by % in rawhtml section)
 - toggle headers doesn't work
 - wxLayout
  + printing takes ages to find .afm files
  + does word wrap work?
  + cursor bitmap occasionally causes segfault in bitmap generation
    (odd dimensions?) (no longer used)
  + horizontal scrollbar doesn't jump to cursorpos when newline
  + "Home" key is funny  (fixed)
  + cursor movement must be displayed properly ( redraw function marked
    with //FIXME)
  + already faster, but could get even faster. Layout/Draw only parts of the list
 - wxllist::Delete() is almost surely broken, but behaves fine
 - treecontrol uses folder names starting with "/" which must not be passed
   to wxFolderView, etc. Folder names do not start with a slash, but are relative.
   Especially, "INBOX" != "/INBOX".
   I added a crude hack to wxMainFrame::OpenFolder() //FIXME
   and wxFolderTree.
 - documentation system should support pictures
 - wxComposeView::Print() fails, wxMessageView::Print() works, why?
