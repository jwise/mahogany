                                        *** WARNING ***

 This is the 0.64 alpha version of the Mahogany e-mail client. "Alpha" means
that many of the features which the finished product will have are still
lacking and that you may (and probably will) find bugs in it. We believe that
Mahogany is already quite useful but we hope to improve it much further - with
your help!

 So please send your impressions, questions, feature requests and bug reports
to our mailing list at
                             mahogany-users@lists.sourceforge.net
and help us to improve this program.

 Thanks for trying Mahogany!
