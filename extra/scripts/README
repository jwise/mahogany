testbuild:

	Small script that can be used to build sources from a variety
	of source directories and with various configure options and
	reports on the success/failure of the various builds.
	Typical example: 
		Build sources from e.g. two directories 
		"mahogany-0.60 mahogany-testbranch"
		in the configuration "debug nodebug". 
	The options for each configuration and the various other i
	parameters can be configured in the script.
		
scancvs:

	Checks the current directory tree for files which are not in the
	cvs. If called as "scancvs remove" it will delete these files.
	This works *OFFLINE* and can be used to check if you forgot to 
	add/commit any files and to re-create a clean tree as of the cvs.
