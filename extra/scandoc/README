ScanDoc - Version 0.12,  A C/C++ Embedded Documentation Analyser
----------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS SCANDOC?

  ScanDoc scans C and C++ program for embedded documentation, and
  formats it into HTML or other formats. It also analyzes code
  structure and uses this information to enhance the generated 
  documentation. It has been inspired by JavaDoc, as well as the 
  Amiga "autodoc" utility.

LICENSING

  ScanDoc is distributed under the "Artistic License" (see the file
  "COPYING" for more information).

DOCUMENTATION

  ScanDoc's documentation can be found in the file "scandoc.html"
  as well as on the web at http://scandoc.sourceforge.net/scandoc.html

INSTALLATION

  ScanDoc doesn't require system installation.  You can simply include
  ScanDoc with the source code you are documenting.  Copy "scandoc",
  your template file (try "templates/default.scandoc" if you haven't
  built your own), and the images directory to your package's
  documentation directory. 

  To see ScanDoc in action, go to the "test" dir and type "make".
  ScanDoc will build documentation for the included test files.
