Windows users: you shouldn't be reading this file, please refer
               to README or doc/build_win.txt instead


The rest of this file is oriented towards Unix users (including Mac
OS X ones) and explains how to build the program from sources.
Please note that we provide some binaries for the Unix platforms as
well and it is much simpler to use them if you have one of the
supported systems. However you do need to rebuild the program
yourself otherwise, in particular the RPMs built for RedHat Linux
most probably will *not* work correctly on the other Linux
distributions even if you manage to install them.

Note: wxWindows name has been changed to wxWidgets recently. Please
      replace accordingly.

Unix compilation instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------

0. Prerequisites
----------------

Required software:

   - wxGTK (GTK+ port of wxWidgets) 2.6.0 or above.

   - GTK+ 1.2.3 or above, 1.2.10 recommended. Mahogany can also be
     built with GTK+ 2 but this is still considered to be
     experimental.

   - GNU make: both wxWidgets and Mahogany may be compiled with many
     different C++ compilers (i.e. not only g++) but they both
     require GNU make, please install it if you don't have it yet
     (it might be available as gmake on some systems)

In addition:

   - If you want to compile Mahogany with SSL support, you must also
     have OpenSSL libraries and headers, see http://www.openssl.org/.
     If you already have them installed but in a non-standard
     location where Mahogany doesn't find them, use --with-ssl=dir
     configure option.

   - If you want to compile Mahogany with Python support, you need
     Python libraries and headers installed. Python 1.5x, 2.0 and
     2.1 are currently supported. You should run configure with
     --with-python option as well. Note that this is currently not
     very useful and may even be brokwn due to lack of interest in
     this functionality.

   - If you want to build integrated dspam statistical spam filter,
     you need SQlite (http://www.sqlite.org/) library. Please note
     that you need version 2.x (2.8.13 was successfully used) and
     not 3.x which is incompatible. For Mac OS X you may get the
     binaries for SQlite from http://www.c-command.com/tools/sqlite.shtml
     but please do "ranlib libsqlite.a" after installing it as
     otherwise Mac OS 10.3+ ld complains about library header and as
     the result it is not detected by configure.

   - To build with Palm support you need pisock library and headers.

   - To rebuild the documentation from sources you need Perl, LaTeX,
     makeindex, dvips, ps2pdf and latex2html - however you may just
     use the prebuilt documentation instead of installing all these
     tools if you don't have them, please see below

   - If you want AvantGo/MAL synchronisation for the PalmOS module,
     you will need to get the libmal.tar.gz library source from the
     Mahogany ftp server and unpack it in the extra/src directory.

Please review configure output and config.log file after running
configure.


1. Compilation of wxWidgets
---------------------------

Before you can compile Mahogany, you will need to have installed
wxWidgets compiled for the GTK library (wxGTK).

The recommended way to build wxWidgets is (from the directory where
it was unpacked):

      mkdir build_dir
      cd build_dir
      ../configure --with-gtk --disable-threads --disable-joystick \
                   --disable-shared

After running configure, do "make" (or "gmake" if your make is not
the GNU make) but notice that you don't have to do "make install"
(although you can if you want to, of course).

If you encounter fatal problems with Mahogany, please try rebuilding
wxWidgets in debug mode:

      mkdir debug_build_dir
      cd debug_build_dir
      ../configure ...same as above... --enable-debug


2. Compilation of Mahogany
--------------------------

Mahogany uses the standard configure script as well, so the simplest
way to compile it is to just type "./configure && make && make
install".

The recommended way to build it is to do the following from the
Mahogany directory:

      mkdir build_dir   # name is arbitrary
      cd build_dir
      ../configure --with-wxdir=path_to_wx/build_dir
      make    # or "make all" to try to build message catalogs as well
      make doc
      make install

The --with-wxdir allows you to use a not installed version of
wxWidgets. You may also add other configure options, of course.
If you use --enable-debug please use --with-wxdir=debug_build_dir,
i.e. always build debug version of Mahogany with debug version of
wxWidgets.

Depending on whether you have installed all required programs in the
right versions, "make doc" and "make install" might fail. Please
download the file Mdocs-<current version>.tar.gz from the
SourceForge download server and put it in the build_dir/doc
directory, then retry.

If you don't want to install the documentation at all, you may do the
following:

    make install_bin     # this will install the program and other
                         # required files
    make install_locale  # this tries to build and install the message
                         # catalogs
    make install_doc     # this should install the documentation and
                         # online help

Mac OS X users only: after a successful make, you may do "make M_bundle"
in build_dir/src directory to create a Mac OS application Mahogany.app.
You may also do "make dmg" to create a disk image containing Mahogany.app.
