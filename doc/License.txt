The Mahogany ``Artistic License''

 Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which
this software package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder
maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development
of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to
use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion,
plus the right to make reasonable modifications. 

This license is based on Perl's ``Artistic License'' and has been adapted
to better suit Mahogany. It aims to confirm with the Open-Source specification.
If you should have any questions about this license, are unhappy with
it or simply would like to comment on it, please get in touch with
us.

 Definitions

``Package'' refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through
textual modification. 

``Standard Version'' refers to such a Package if it has not been modified,
or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright
Holder as specified below. 

``Copyright Holder'' is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights
for the package. 

``You'' is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this
Package. 

``Reasonable copying fee'' is whatever you can justify on the basis
of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so
on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder,
but only to the computing community at large as a market that must
bear the fee.) 

``Freely Available'' means that no fee is charged for the item itself,
though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means
that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions
they received it. 

Conditions of Use

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of
  the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided
  that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated
  disclaimers and only distribute the complete package as a whole. 

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
  derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package
  modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version. 

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
  that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating
  how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at
  least ONE of the following: 

  (a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make
    them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to
    Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on
    a major archive site such as sunsite.unc.edu, or by allowing the
    Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard
    Version of the Package, and rename any non-standard executables
    so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which
    must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for
    each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs
    from the Standard Version. You must not make the modified version
    depend on any other software or libary if that software or libary
    is not Freely Available or if it is covered under a license more
    restrictive than this. 

  (b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

  (c) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. 

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
  executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following: 

  (a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent)
    on where to get the Standard Version. 

  (b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
    the Package with your modifications, including the complete machine-readable
    source of the unmodified Standard Version. You must not make the
    modified version depend on any other software or libary if that
    software or libary is not Freely Available or if it is covered
    under a license more restrictive than this. 

  (c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document
    the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with
    instructions on where to get the Standard Version. d.make other
    distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. 

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
  Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package.
  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may
  distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial)
  programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution
  provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of
  your own. 

6. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
  products derived from this software without specific prior written
  permission. However, all products derived from this software must
  reproduce the original copyright notice as found in the Standard
  Version. 

7. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED ``AS IS'' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
  WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
  OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
