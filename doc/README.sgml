<date>0.0 ($Revision$)
<abstract>
This document is a set of notes about how to compile and install M. It
also covers some frequently asked questions.
</abstract>

<toc>

<sect>Introduction
<p>
<em/M/ is intended to be a powerful mail and news client. The
following points were significant in the development of it
<enum>
<item>
it should have an easy to use graphical user interface
<item>
it should be powerful, being able to replace awkward tools such as
procmail, thus it must have a built in scripting language
<item>
it should have full support for a wide range of standards, including
full MIME support
<item>
it should run on a wide variety of systems
</enum>

<sect>Compilation notes

<sect1>Operating systems specific

<sect2>Linux

If compiling with a non-default compiler like egcs, make sure that
<tt>/usr/include</tt> is not in the include path, neither should
<tt>/usr/lib</tt> be explicitly listed.

<sect2>Solaris/SunOS

<sect1>Other issues/libraries

<sect2>STL
<em/M/ uses the STL, so you need a sufficiently recent compiler,
i.e. <tt/egcs/ or <tt/gcc-2.8/.

<sect2>Python
<tt/configure/ looks for Python in
<tt>/usr/local/src/Python-1.3</tt>. If your Python is installed in a
different location, change the variable <tt/PYTHON_PATH/ at the
beginning of <tt/configure/. 

<sect2>XFaces
If you have the <tt/compface/ library and header file installed, it
will be used to support XFaces.

<sect>Installation

<sect1>Configuration and Compilation

<p>
Follow these steps:
<enum>

<item>
Edit <tt/configure/ so it will find your installation  of
<tt/Python/. If you do not have it, just skip this step.

<item>
Run <tt>./configure</tt> to create the <tt>include/config.h</tt> and
<tt>makeopts</tt> file. It may be required to edit <tt/makeopts/ by
hand.

<item>
Run <tt/make dep/ and <tt/cd src/ and <tt/make/ to compile and link
<em/M/. Compiling some of the source files will take an enormous
amount of memory, so make sure you have enough virtual memory.

</enum>
