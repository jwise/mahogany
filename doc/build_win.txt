0. Requirements
---------------

a) a compiler: currently, the supported compilers for building Mahogany are
   MS Visual C++ 7.1 and cygwin. Previous versions of Visual C++ (5/6/7.0)
   could probably be used as well but the project files haven't been updated
   for them since quite some time and so this definitely won't work out of
   the box but require some effort from your part. Later versions of VC++ (VC8,
   a.k.a. 2005, and VC9 a.k.a. 2008) should work as well but you need to import
   the projects which are only available in VC7 versions currently.

   If you are interested in building using another compiler (mingw32, BC++)
   please contact us and we will try to help you.

b) svn client: you need to have daily access to Mahogany (and sometimes
   wxWidgets) source tree, and the svn is the only way to keep up to date.

c) GNU m4 from cygwin tools: this is not an absolute requirement, however you
   will not be able to compile *.mid (Mahogany Interface Description) files if
   you don't have it and so you will have to use the versions already in the
   svn. If you do have m4, set the environment variable M4 to contain its full
   path (or just m4 if it is in your PATH), otherwise it won't be used.


1. Visual C++
-------------

a) wxWidgets
------------

   Mahogany depends on wxWidgets and prior to compiling Mahogany you need to
build the wxMSW library.

   Currently Mahogany requires wxWidgets sources from svn (it is possible to
build against wx 2.8 but the project files have been modified to be used with
svn wx version so you'd need to use an older version of them to build with 2.8,
please contact me if you really need to do this). When wx 2.9.0 is release it
will be possible to use it too.

   Before building Mahogany you will need to build wxWidgets. To do it, you
should open build/msw/wx_vc7.sln in wxWidgets directory and build all projects
in it. You may use extra\scripts\wxmsw_setup.h file instead of the standard
setup.h when building if you want to disable all the features not needed by
Mahogany but doing this is optional and you should revert to the standard
wx/setup.h if using wxmsw_setup.h results in errors (it is not always up to
date...).


b) Python
---------

   If you want to build Mahogany with an embedded Python interpreter, you need
to download the source distribution of Python from http://www.python.org/,
built it using the provided project file (in versions up to 2.3.3 it is for
VC++ 6 but can be imported without problems in VC++ 7.x) in PCbuild
subdirectory and add the path to include subdirectory to your global VC++
settings.

   Otherwise you may simply remove or comment out the line #defining USE_PYTHON
in include/config_nt.h to disable embedded Python. You will also have to
exclude files in "interfaces\python" subfolder of "Source file" in M project
from build.


c) Build process
----------------

   Before loading M.sln file, you will need to open it in your favourite text
editor and do a global search of replace of "L:\wxWidgets" with the path where
your wxWidgets installation is. You also must have "wxwin" environment variable
set to point to the same location (as per wxWidgets installation instructions).

   After this you can open the solution file M.sln in Visual C++ IDE. Here is a
brief description of various projects in the solution:

* M - the main Mahogany project
* imap - the mail routines support library
* compface - the library for X-Face handling
* versit - vCard library
* dspam - the spam filtering library
* base, core, ... - wxWidgets projects

   Finally, just build everything. Before running M.exe, copy the file
versit.dll produced when building versit project into the root Mahogany
directory (or elsewhere in your PATH).

   If you encounter any problems with Mahogany (e.g. crashes...), please build
the debug configuration and run it under debugger, this often provides valuable
additional information.


2. Cygwin
---------

a) Build process
----------------

g++ 3.x can not compile Mahogany currently, so I used g++ 2.95.3. As compiler
version should be the same when compiling both wxWidgets and Mahogany, we should
use g++ 2.95.3 for compiling wxWidgets as well. Just use

cd <path to wxWidgets sources>
mkdir build.cygwin.gcc295
cd build.cygwin.gcc295
CC=gcc-2 CXX=g++-2 ../configure
make
make install

cd <path to Mahogany sources>
mkdir build.cygwin.gcc295
cd build.cygwin.gcc295
CC=gcc-2 CXX=g++-2 ../configure --with-modules=static
make
make install

in cygwin bash shell.

You can also compile with -mno-cygwin switch, i.e. mingw version. Use
CC='gcc-2 -mno-cygwin' CXX='g++-2 -mno-cygwin' OSTYPE=mingw ../configure --with-modules=static


b) Common problems
------------------

Linking Mahogany compiled with debug info requires a lot of memory, so please
disable debugging if you experience out of memory problems.

SSL does not work with cygwin.

IMAP does not work with mingw.


3. WINE
-------

Although it's not for building under MS Windows, we'll describe it here.

a) Build process
----------------

cd <path to Mahogany sources>
mkdir build.wine
cd build.wine
CC=winegcc CXX=wineg++ ../configure --without-python --without-dspam --with-modules=static --disable-dialup --without-ssl
make

vi: ts=8 sw=3 nolist nocin ai:
