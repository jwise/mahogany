0. Requirments
--------------

a) a compiler: currently, the only supported compiler for building Mahogany is
   Visual C++ 6.0. Version 5.0 of it can be used as well. If you are interested
   in building using another compiler (mingw32, BC++) please contact me and I
   will try to help you

b) cvs client: you need to have daily access to Mahogany (and sometimes
   wxWindows) source tree, and the cvs is the only way to keep up to date. The
   precompiled cvs binaries for Win32 can be found at http://www.cyclic.com/

c) GNU m4 from cygwin tools: this is not an absolute requirment, however you
   will not be able to compile *.mid (Mahogany Interface Description) files if
   you don't have it and so you will have to use the versions already in the
   cvs. If you do have m4, set the environment variable M4 to contain its full
   path (or just m4 if it is in your PATH), otherwise it won't be used.


1. wxWindows
------------

   Mahogany depends on wxWindows and prior to compiling Mahogany you need to
build the wxMSW library.

   You may use either wxMSW 2.4.1 release (latest 2.4 release as of the time
of this writing, if a newer one is available, do use it) or the latest
wxWindows sources from cvs HEAD which usually provide more functionality.

   Mahogany now uses the standard wxWindows project files so just build
wxWindows using the provided src/wxWindows.dsp project. You will need to point
MSDEV to this file when you open M.dsw workspace for the first time. You also
should build wxWindows with the standard include\wx\msw\setup.h instead of
the file extra\scripts\wxmsw_setup.h which had to be used previously.


2. Build process
----------------

   Open the project workspace M.dsw in Visual C++ IDE. You will have to load
(right click the project in the project tree, choose "Load") the following
projects contained in this workspace if they are not loaded yet:

* cclient - the mail routines support library
* compface - the library for X-Face handling
* M - the main Mahogany project
* versit - vCard handling routines
* wxWindows - the wxMSW library: when opening this project, specify the correct
              file location (in Mahogany directory) when asked

    Note that after building everything (successfully) once, you may unload all
the projects except "M" -- this will speed up workspace opening/closing. But if
you do it, be careful to load them all before rebuilding everything --
otherwise, dependencies will not be handled correctly.

    Finally, just build everything. Before running M.exe, copy the file
versit.dll produced when building versit project into the root Mahogany
directory (or elsewhere in your PATH).


3. Common problems
------------------

Visual C++ 5.0 doesn't understand environment variables in the project
settings, so you will need to replace the occurences of $(wx) with the value
of the variable.

If you don't have yacc or bison on your system, you will need to manually copy
src/wx/vcard/vcc.c-yacc to vcc.c.

If you get problem with PROIO_yywrap being multiply defined in wxWindows,
comment out the 2nd definition of this function in src/common/y_tab.c.
