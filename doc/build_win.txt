0. Requirments
--------------

a) a compiler: currently, the only supported compiler for building Mahogany is
   Visual C++ 6.0. Version 5.0 of it can be used as well. If you are interested
   in building using another compiler (mingw32, BC++) please contact me and I
   will try to help you

b) cvs client: you need to have daily access to Mahogany (and so far wxWindows)
   source tree, and the cvs is the only way to keep up to date. The precompiled
   cvs binaries for Win32 can be found at http://www.cyclic.com.

c) GNU m4 from cygwin tools: this is not an absolute requirment, however you
   will not be able to compile *.mid (Mahogany Interface Description) files if
   you don't have it and so you will have to use the versions already in the
   cvs. If you don't have m4, build process will fail: to get around it,
   exclude the file Minterface.mid from build.

1. wxWindows
------------

   Mahogany depends on wxWindows and prior to compiling Mahogany you need to
build the wxMSW library. However, do *not* follow the standard build
instructions included into wxWindows distribution. For historical reasons I am
using my own project file to build wxWindows version used by Mahogany: it is
included in Mahogany cvs and is called wxWindows.dsp. You should move this
file to the directory where you installed wxWindows. You will also need to
copy extra\scripts\wxmsw_setup.h to include\wx\msw\setup.h of your wxWindows
installation. Notice that this is mandatory, do *not* try to build wxWindows
using other settings unless you know what you are doing or you are sure to run
into trouble.

   Also, please set the environment variable "wx" to contain the location of
the directory where wxWindows is installed: e.g., "d:\progs\libs\wxWindows".

   Finally, a note about cvs access: currently, you must use "-r WX_2_2_BRANCH"
switch when you do "cvs co" or "cvs up" wxWindows for the first time to get the
files from 2.2 branch. It is not necessary to specify this switch subsequently.

2. Build process
----------------

   Open the project workspace M.dsw inVisual C++ IDE. You will have to load
(right click the project in the project tree, choose "Load") the following
projects contained in this workspace if they are not loaded yet:

* cclient - the mail routines support library
* compface - the library for X-Face handling
* M - the main Mahogany project
* versit - vCard handling routines
* wxWindows - the wxMSW library: when opening this project, specify the correct
              file location (in Mahogany directory) when asked

    Note that after building everything (successfully) once, you may unload all
the projects except "M" - this will speed up workspace opening/closing. But if
you do it, be careful to load them all before rebuilding everything -
otherwise, dependencies will not be handled correctly.

    Finally, just build everything. Before running M.exe, copy the file
versit.dll produced when building versit project into the root Mahogany
directory (or elsewhere in your PATH).

3. Common problems
------------------

Visual C++ 5.0 doesn't understand environment variables in the project
settings, so you will need to replace the occurences of $(wx) with the value
of the variable.

If you don't have yacc or bison on your system, you will need to manually copy
src/wx/vcard/vcc.c-yacc to vcc.c.

If you get problem with PROIO_yywrap being multiply defined in wxWindows,
comment out the 2nd definition of this function in src/common/y_tab.c.
