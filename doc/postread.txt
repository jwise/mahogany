Please consult files in the doc subdirectory (in particular, the list
of known bugs in bugs.txt) and the help file for further details.

We also hope that Mahogany interface is simple enough that you may
start using it right now.

And don't forget that the most up-to-date documentation is always
available online at M home page: please see
