Release Notes_1001_</A>
</H1>

<P>
This is another public release of Mahogany. As with usual we make
the source available and binaries for the most common operating systems
supported. Mahogany should generally work on any Unix flavour. 

<P>
Due to the fact that it is a cross-platform effort, the compilation
and make system are a bit more complex than the average package. However,
the source code is provided and you can attempt to compile it yourself.
If you are trying to port it to a new platform, let us know and we
will be happy to help you.

0.62 against 0.61</A>
</H3>

<P>
The main changes in this release concern the Mahogany internals: the
stability and efficiency have been both greatly improved, in particular
it is believed that all fatal crashes using IMAP servers are now gone.
Deleting, expunging and changing the status of the messages is now
much faster, especially for the folders with a lot of messages. Of
course, there are also several new features:

<P>

<UL><LI>Order of the folders in the folder tree is customizable, the system
folders appear at the top (and not scattered through the tree in alphabetical
order)

<LI>Support for flagging the messages was added, the folders containing
flagged messages are shown in a different colour in the folder tree

<LI>All folders opened the last time can be remembered and reopened during
the next run

<LI><TT>TEXT/PLAIN</TT> attachments can now be optionally shown inline

<LI>hard limit on number of retrieved messages was added (see <A HREF="Manual.html#limitdatatransfer">4.2.2</A>)

</UL>
Many bugs have been fixed:

<P>

<UL><LI>sending mail with local MTA (sendmail) respects BCC settings

<LI>temporary files with mail messages are not created world readable
any more

<LI>language autodetection fixed

<LI>messages with embedded MIME attachments are shown correctly

<LI>server side searching on IMAP servers works

<LI>renaming folders was fixed

<LI>crashes when: viewing messages with incorrect date, deleting some
folders and some others were fixed

</UL>
And a few improvements too:

<P>

<UL><LI>better UI for the filters dialogs

<LI>messages can now also be sorted by status and by size

<LI>a hard limit on number of the messages retrieved can be set

</UL>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00211200000000000000">
0.61 against 0.60 </A>
</H3>

<P>
Note: the version 0.61 wasn't officially released

<P>
A couple of new features, most importantly:

<P>

<UL><LI>Possibility to save (to the address book) all addresses from a message
appearinganywhere in the headers.

<LI>It is now possible to import all folder files in MBOX (Unix) format
using ''F<SMALL>OLDER|</SMALL>I<SMALL>MPORT FOLDER TREE...</SMALL>'' command (see
<A HREF="Manual.html#Import">1.4.5</A>)

</UL>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00211300000000000000">
0.60 against 0.50</A>
</H3>

<P>
Most importantly, all known major bugs in 0.5 have been fixed in this
release. We still have some minor buglets and lots of wishes and enhancements
on our list, but all serious bugs should be gone now. A couple of
new features have been added:

<P>

<UL><LI>fixes to all serious bugs from version 0.50

<LI>significantly improved IMAP support: it is now possible to subscribe
to all folders on an IMAP server with a single click or to manually
select them from a dialog; Mahogany also uses server side message
functions when possible resulting in huge performance improvement

<LI>new, improved filtering system (warning: old filters won't work any
more, contact us if this is really a serious problem for you)

<LI>charset and encoding support for message contents and headers (including
autodetecting the charset of incoming messages and setting it for
the outgoing ones)

<LI>mail can be sent using local MTA (sendmail) in addition to SMTP

<LI>import of settings and folder collections from Pine and XFMail, vCard
support (import/export from addess book, attach to messages)

<LI>drag and drop for message copying and moving - &#34;Quick Move&#34;
and &#34;Quick Filter&#34; functions 

<LI>folders now can (finally) be renamed 

<LI>quoted text highlighting in the message viewer! 

<LI>sort the messages display by simply clicking on the corresponding
column, the sorting dialog also has been improved 

<LI>folders with new/recent messages are highlighted in the folder tree 

<LI>it is possible (although still discouraged) to run Mahogany as root 

<LI>passwords in the config file are encrypted using TwoFish algorithm 

<LI>option to always use external editor by default 

<LI>messages from oneself are optionally marked as such 

<LI>support for password protected SMTP and NNTP servers 

<LI>more verbose error reporting and detection 

<LI>OpenSSL loaded dynamically if available 

<LI>PalmOS module supports AvantGo/MAL synchronisation 

<LI>templates now may be used for replying/forwarding as well 

<LI>many other various fixes

</UL>
<B>New experimental features include:</B>

<P>

<UL><LI>supporting multiple-identities and easy switching between them 

<LI>support of storing configuration settings on an IMAP server allowing
to share them between different machines/accounts

</UL>
<B>Known bugs:</B> 

<P>

<UL><LI>There are always some, listed on our bugtracker at http://mahogany.sourceforge.net/bugz/
and we are working on them.

<LI>Version 0.60 suffers from a minor printing bug leading to some overlap
between strings sometimes, which is due to a bug in wxWindows which
will hopefully be fixed fairly soon.

</UL>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00211400000000000000">
0.5 against 0.23a</A>
</H3>

<P>
This release has long been delayed, mainly due to us waiting for changes
in wxWindows to be completed. As we introduced new features in the
meantime, those introduced new delays, and so on. It has been more
than half a year since the last release, so changes are major. We
hope to stick to a much faster cycle of minor update releases for
the future. The main new features are:

<P>

<UL><LI>Proper support for MH folders.

<LI>Browsing and subscription management for IMAP and NNTP servers.

<LI>A plugin module system has been created which allows to dynamically
load expansion modules. Existing modules (statically linked in this
release, but dynamically linkable) include a filtering language and
PalmOS support. For the future, a calendar/timeplanner plugin is planned.

<LI>Configurable filtering rules have been added.

<LI>Message threading and configurable sort order is supported.

<LI>An HTML-based help browser has been added. 

<LI>Configurable date format.

<LI>Handling of dial-up networking and detection of connection status.

<LI>Optional user of a Trash folder.

<LI>Wizard-dialogs and ``tip of the day'' dialogs added to make
Mahogany easier to use.

<LI>Optional SSL support can be compiled in (not activated by default
due to US export restrictions), allowing secure access to mail and
news servers.

<LI>PalmOS handheld connectivity: synchronise e-mails with your PalmOS
handheld computer and use its addressbook within Mahogany. Also, backup,
restore and install databases of your handheld.

<LI>Bug fixes in nearly all parts of the code. Mahogany should suffer
much less from crashes than earlier versions. The message editor behaves
better and is faster.

<LI>Minor GUI improvements like keyboard bindings and nicer icons. Support
for KDE and GNOME filetype icons.

</UL>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00211500000000000000">
0.23a against 0.22a</A>
</H3>

<P>
The main news is, of course, the long-waited for availability of Win32
version. Also:

<P>

<UL><LI>Several bugs in message composer (including a few fatal ones) were
fixed. Only minor problems still persist.

<LI>Selections support (copy, cut, paste) in message composer and viewer.

<LI>The <TT>[Apply]</TT>and<TT>[Cancel]</TT>buttons in the options
and folder properties dialogs (mostly) work now.

<LI>Several minor bug fixes and improvements, including a massive speedup
in the update of folder listings over slow connections.

<LI>Printing no longer has overlap between pages.

<LI>Folders can be kept open all the time to speed up access to them,
very useful for ``SentMail'' folder.

<LI>Better behaved, asks before removing all mail from spool.

<LI>Configurable templates for message composition and replies.

<LI>Message boxes now have icons in them.

<LI>Searching in mail folders.

<LI>And, of course, updated translations and documentation updates.

</UL>
We have also made good progress on the filtering code, PGP/GPG support,
multi-threading support and support for loadable external modules,
but these features are not complete yet and disabled in the release.
Expect them to appear in the next releases.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00211600000000000000">
0.22a against 0.21a</A>
</H3>

<P>
Release 0.22a is mainly a bugfix release against 0.21a.

<P>

<UL><LI>All know (crash-inducing) bugs fixed. 

<LI>Message editor/viewer improvements, adding clipboard support and selections. 

<LI>wxGTK layout bug fixes - German, French, Spanish translations 

<LI>Text-search in messages 

<LI>Several minor usability fixes, sub-folder support fixed. 

<LI>Addressbook fixes 

<LI>TCP timeouts configurable 

<LI>Support for setting the Reply-To: header from To: field in message
replies.

<P>
First, there are some user-visible changes against the latest version,
most notably the much improved message editor. This is still work
in progress and the next release should add the sorely missed cut
and paste support which only recently became functional in the underlying
wxGTK toolkit. Also, configurability has been much extended. For the
first time, Mahogany now defaults to collecting all mail from the
system's INBOX (whatever that is) to a central ``New Mail''
folder. It can easily be set up to watch any number of different mail
accounts or newsgroups and collect mail from them.

<P>
This release got a bit delayed because we decided to finish some long
planned changes under the hood, mainly a complete rewrite of the internal
configuration system which now provides the inheriting configuration
settings we had planned, something that will become obvious in the
next release when full GUI support for it will be added. Also, we
seriously improved the mailfolder handling code to reliably handle
all kinds of error conditions, such as modified or disappearing mailboxes
or terminated connections and recover from them safely. Also, Mahogany
now has full working support for IMAP, NNTP and newsspools.

<P>
Apart from this there were many minor fixes and changes, both GUI
and mail code, documented in detail at the end of the TODO file.

<P>
To get started on Mahogany, you should look at the following sections
of this manual:

<P>

<UL><LI>The Folder Tree (<A HREF="Manual.html#FolderTreeCtrl">1.4.2</A>) and how to create new folders
(<A HREF="Manual.html#CreateNewFolderDialog">1.4.3</A>).

<LI>The explanation of the INBOX (<A HREF="Manual.html#INBOX_Folder">1.5.1</A>) and New Mail (<A HREF="Manual.html#New_Mail_Folder">1.5.2</A>)
folders.

</UL>
Obviously, the more of this manual you read, the better use you can
make of Mahogany. Once the manual has grown too large, we will provide
a short tutorial, but for now we go on coding instead.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00221000000000000000">
Getting started</A>
</H2>

<P>
When you start Mahogany for the first time, it will present you with
a rather lengthy configuration dialog where you can configure all
kinds of more or less useful options. Don't be afraid of it - just
make sure that the main points, notably the settings on the Identity
(<A HREF="Manual.html#IdentityPage">1.7.2</A>) and Network (<A HREF="Manual.html#NetworkPage">1.7.2</A>) page are correct
and ignore the rest for now. The defaults should be suitable for most
situations.

<P>
The main window will then show you a tree of folders (<A HREF="Manual.html#FolderTreeCtrl">1.4.2</A>)
on the left and a view of the currently selected folder (<A HREF="Manual.html#FolderView">1.4.4</A>)
to the right of it. By default, you will find a small number of folders
that Mahogany sets up for you, usually these are ``INBOX'',
``SentMail'' and ``New Mail''. So, what are they? 

<P>

<UL><LI>``SentMail'' is obvious, Mahogany will store copies of messages
that you send in there. 

<LI>``INBOX'' is a little more tricky, it represents the ``system
inbox'' for your system. This depends on your system setup, on
Unix, it will most commonly be the <TT>/var/spool/mail</TT> or <TT>/var/mail</TT>
entry for you, or wherever new mail for you gets stored. If you have
an existing <TT>mbox</TT> or <TT>INBOX</TT> mailfolder in your home
directory, as created by some other mail software, it will refer to
this. Generally, you don't need to worry about it, it will just be
a black-box showing you new mail on the system you are logged in to.
If it should not work, you can just create a folder entry for wherever
the mail gets stored and ignore <TT>INBOX</TT>.

<LI>``New Mail'' is just a normal file folder, which is used by
Mahogany to store mail that it collects from other places. By default,
Mahogany will attempt to collect all new mail arriving in <TT>INBOX</TT>
and move it to ``New Mail'', as it is considered bad practice
to leave messages in the system spool area. Also, if you want to collect
mail from more than one location, for example from your ISP's POP
account, Mahogany will move it to ``New Mail''. It's just a
convenient central place to store new messages, so you have them all
in one folder, no matter where they come from. Of course, you can
change this, if you don't like it. Whether Mahogany collects mail
from a folder or not, can be set in the Properties dialog of the folder,
accessible via a click with the right mouse button in the folder tree.
If you try this, you will see, that Mahogany is set up to collect
from ``INBOX'', but not from ``SentMail''. Good.

</UL>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00222000000000000000">
So how about setting up POP access? And what is IMAP?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Setting up POP access is dead easy: You simply click the right mouse
button in the folder tree and select ``Create new folder''.
Then fill in the details: your username and password for accessing
the account and the hostname of the POP server. Optionally you can
enter a port number after a colon. By default, Mahogany will collect
all mail from here and move it to ``New Mail'' automatically.
If you don't want this (i.e. you prefer to leave the messages on server
or maybe only move some of them to ``New Mail'' selectively
using filters), clear the ``Collect all mail'' checkbox. Note
that the default behaviour works better in most cases and that it
is impossible to remember the status of the messages on a POP3 server
so if you do leave on it, they will always appear as new, even if
you had already seen them before.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00222100000000000000">
IMAP - what's that?</A>
</H3>

<P>
IMAP is POP's big brother. Faster, more powerful and better, even
more secure. If your ISP supports it, use IMAP rather than POP, your
phone bills will go down, too. It's really just a different protocol
for accessing the folder, but can do a few fancy things, more about
that later.

servers or mail return addresses. Entries prefixed with an exclamation

Access_2005_</A>

<P>

<UL><LI><B><A NAME="FolderAccessPage"></A>Folder Type</B>
<BR>
Here you can choose from the currently supported folder types. The
``News'' type is for reading a local newsspool, it is only partially
supported at present but should work fine in most circumstances. ``NNTP''
is for reading news from a remote newsserver. ``IMAP'' and ``POP3''
are for accessing remote mail server. If possible, prefer IMAP over
POP, it is much more powerful and significantly faster, saving modem
time.

<LI><B>User name</B>
<BR>
For those folder types where it is required, the user name or login
to get access to them.

<LI><B>Password</B>
<BR>
For those folder types where it is required, you can specify the password
here. If you leave it empty, Mahogany will prompt you for the password
whenever it is needed. If you want to auto-collect mail from this
folder, you should really specify it. <B>This is a potential
security risk!</B> The password typed in here will get stored in your
$HOME/.M/config configuration file on Unix or in the registry on
Windows. While this file will be created as only readable by you and
the passwords be encrypted (using very weak encryption), it is nevertheless
a certain risk. If you accidentally change the permissions of that
file, someone else could obtain your passwords, though Mahogany would
detect this the next time it starts and warn you about it. Generally
this should not pose a problem, but you should be aware of this. Previous
versions of Mahogany had the passwords world-readable, so if you used
it before this release, you might want to change them.

<LI><B>Server</B>
<BR>
For the folders which require a server setting, you can specify the
server host here. If unspecified they will inherit the setting from
the global preferences.

<LI><B>Newsgroup</B>
<BR>
For NNTP and Newsspool folders, the name of the newsgroup, e.g. comp.os.linux.announce
.

<LI><B>Comment</B>
<BR>
Whatever you like to add.

<LI><B>File name</B>
<BR>
For folders of type ``File'', the filename or MH directory.

<LI><B>Collect all mail from this folder</B>
<BR>
Makes this folder ``incoming''. Mahogany will regularly check
the folder for new mail and move any messages to the global folder
for new mail, usually the ``New Mail'' folder.

<LI><B>Keep folder always open</B>
<BR>
If selected, Mahogany will attempt to open the folder at program start
and keep it open all the time. This can significantly speed up access
to large folders as opening them can take some time. A very useful
option for frequently used folders, such as, for example, the folder
where you save copies of outgoing messages.

<LI><B>Force re-open on ping</B>
<BR>
This forces Mahogany to close and re-open the mailbox when trying
to update the information about it. This is required for some POP
servers to correctly detect new mail. Usually this should not be needed.

<LI><B>Use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</B>
<BR>
This option is not always available, as the use of strong cryptography
is outlawed in some dictatorical countries. If your copy of Mahogany
supports SSL, tick this box to access a secure IMAP/POP/NNTP server.
Must be supported by the server side, too. It will ensure that your
communication with the server is encrypted and safe from eavesdropping.

<LI><B>Anonymous access</B>
<BR>
This marks the folder as anonymous, such as for anonymous IMAP access,
telling Mahogany that no user name or password are required to access
it.

<LI><B>Is directory</B>
<BR>
Select this if the mailbox represents not a mailbox or newsgroup but
a hierarchy on an IMAP or NNTP server. E.g. comp.os.linux.announce
would be a normal newsgroup (unticked), while comp.os.linux would
be a new hierarchy (ticket).

<LI><B>Hide folder in tree</B>
<BR>
If you do not want this mailbox to be shown in the folder tree (unless
you select the option to show all hidden folders), tick this box.

<LI><B>Folder subtype</B>
<BR>
Here you can select some sub-type, e.g. different mailbox formats.

<LI><B>Icon for this folder</B>
<BR>
Allows you to set a different icon for the mailbox.

sort order which may be changed either from the folder properties
dialog (of course, it can be set independently for each folder or
be the same for all folders at once) or by clicking on the column
header. In the latter case, clicking on, for example, ``S<SMALL>UBJECT</SMALL>''
column, will sort the messages by subject if they were not sorted
by subject already, otherwise it will sort them by subject in the
reverse order. This allows you to sort the listing on some column
by just clicking it and to reverse the sort order by clicking it again.

<P>
Most of the columns are self explanatory. It should be mentioned that
the date format is configurable from the folder view page of the folder
properties dialog and you may set it to anything you like. In particular,
some people find it very useful to show the date in GMT instead of
the local time.

<P>
The status column (which is usually the first one, although you may
change the column order from the same page already mentioned above)
may be empty or contain one or more flags:

<P>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3 BORDER="1">

<TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER">N</TD>
<TD ALIGN="CENTER">message is new: it is recent and unread</TD>

</TABLE>

<P>
Accordingly, if nothing appears in the status column, the message
was read but wasn't deleted nor flagged and this is not the first
time you see it. Note that not all kinds of folders support all kinds
of flags: while IMAP servers always do, POP servers are not capable
of storing the message flags and so all messages will always appear
as new in them.

<P>
Note that each message flag has also the corresponding colour which
is used to highlight the message in the folder view and also to highlight
the folder containing this message in the folder tree. These colours
can be changed from the folder view page of the options dialog, as
usual.

Keyboard and mouse handling</A>
</H3>

<P>
The reaction to a mouse click in the list of messages depends on the
preferences setting ``Preview message when selected``. When
the option is selected, a single mouse click will select the message
and load it into the preview window. If the option is not set, the
message will only be selected but not previewed automatically, which
is very useful for accessing mail folders through a slow connection.
The same setting effects the behaviour of the space bar, it acts exactly
like a single mouse click in the window and will only cause a message
to be previewed if a single mouse click is configured to do so. The
space key can be used to view the message under the current cursor.

Migrating from another mail client</A>

<A NAME="Import"></A><I>Mahogany</I> supports importing the settings from
a few other popular mail clients. The current list includes Pine,
XFMail and Eudora. Depending on the mail client only part of its settings
may be imported but in the best case Mahogany can import the address
books, the configuration settings, the filter rules and the list of
folders to use. To use this feature, choose ``M<SMALL>AIL|</SMALL>I<SMALL>MPORT...</SMALL>''
command and follow the dialogs.

<P>
Even if you don't find your email client in the list proposed in the
dialog, everything is not lost. You won't be able to import its configuration
information nor the filter rules but you might still recuperate the
address book information if your program can export the addresses
in the standard comma separated format or as vCards. In either case
you can then import just the address books from the address book editor.

<P>
Finally, <I>Mahogany</I> can automatically create the entries in the
folder tree for all MBOX (standard Unix format, also used by Eudora)
files under the given directory. To do this, select the folder in

Mahogany should in all situations recover from closed connections

The folders are organized in a tree structure: this is purely for
the convenience of the user, so any folder may contain as many other
folders as needed. Folders can be managed either from the top level
menu or from the popup menu in the folder control invoked by pressing
the right mouse button in it. You can group folders together by making
the sub folders of another folder. This builds no physical connection
between the folders but makes the sub folder inherit certain configuration
defaults settings from their parent folder. We will soon add a ``folder
group'' folder type not representing any mailbox but just being
a group of folders.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00254000000000000000">
Accessing Mail Remotely</A>
</H2>

<P>
Mahogany supports two protocols for accessing remote mail servers:
POP3 and IMAP. While POP3 is more commonly available, IMAP is definitely
the superiour protocol and should be used where available. It will
generally give you more functionality and will be much faster over
slow connections. Both normally require you to log in with a username
and password, but can be configured to work anonymously if supported
by the server. IMAP additionally allows you to access any mailfolder
file on the remote machine. For example, if you use Mahogany on a
remote machine ``<TT>atwork.company.com</TT>'', you might have
your local <TT>INBOX</TT> (which could be <TT>/var/spool/mail/MyUserName</TT>
on a unix box) and also your ``New Mail'' folder, which usually
is ``<TT>/.M/New Mail</TT>''. With IMAP, if
you log in from home, you can not only access your INBOX on the atwork.company.com
mail server, but also the ``<TT>New Mail</TT>'' folder there,
by telling Mahogany to use ``<TT>/home/MyUserName/.M/New Mail</TT>''
as the path to the mailbox file. Like this, you can access any mail
folder on that machine that you have access to locally, making remote
access to your mail much more flexible than just accessing your new
messages.

Using Folder names as an address</A>

<P>
Folder names can be entered by prefixing them with a hash ('#') sign.
This will cause a copy of the message to be saved in the folder with
this name. If no such folder exists, it will be created in the mail
folder directory. For example, entering ``joe.user@foo.com, #myMail''
in the To: field, will send the mail to Joe User and save a copy of
it in the folder ``myMail''. Note, that if you have your folders
organised hierarchically, you must specify the full path to the folder
in the folder tree control. An example: If you have a group of folders
in the tree, called ``Work'' and want to save a copy of the
message to the folder ``TODO'' which is a sub-folder of ``Work'',
you need to add ``#Work/TODO'' in the address field. Instead
of using the To: field for this, you can also use CC: or BCC:, there
is no difference.

Using the address book_3100_</A>
</H2>

<P>
Although you may directly enter the addresses of recipients of your
message into the different address fields (``To:``, ``Cc:``
and ``Bcc:`` although the last two are optional and so might
not appear), there is a more convenient way to do it using the address
book. To insert an address fromyour address book you should type the
first few letters of either the ``nick name'' (or the ``alias'')
for this address or the the first letters of the e-mail address and
press &lt;TAB&gt; key or click on the ``Expand'' button. If there
is only one possible expansion for the letters you have typed, Mahogany
will automatically replace them with the corresponding full e-mail
address. Other possible cases: either there are no matches at all
and a message in the status line of the window will tell you so, or
there are more than one match in which case you will be presented
with a choice of all possible completions. 

<P>
<I>Hint:</I> if you press &lt;TAB&gt; immediately after the address expansion
it will bring you to the next text entry zone and will not attempt
the address expansion the second time.

<P>
A special feature of the address expansion is the so-called ``group
extension'': if you type the first few letters of an address group
name (see ``Address Book Editor'' description for more about
it) it will be replaced by the addresses of all the addresses in this
group. So, for example, if you have a group called ``Friends''
you may type ``fri'' in the ``To:`` text entry zone and
after pressing &lt;TAB&gt; it will be replaced by the e-mail addresses of
all your friends.

The Mail Composition Window_2100_</A>
</H2>

<P>
<A NAME="MailCompositionWindow"></A>The composition window's appearance
depends on your configuration settings (<A HREF="Manual.html#ComposePage">1.7.2</A>). Generally,
it will at least show text entry fields to specify who to send the
message to, for the subject and a large editing window below for the
actual message itself. It also features an EXPAND button next to the
address field, which allows you to lookup addresses in the currently
loaded addressbooks. If you type in the beginning or a substring of
a name, alias or email address and either press the expand button
or the tabulator key, Mahogany will look up a list of matching addressbook
entries and either expand it directly or prompt you with the matching
choices. This works for the main address field (``To'') as well
as for the carbon copy addresses (``CC'' and ``BCC'').
If you specify an address in the ``CC'' or ``BCC'' fields,
these people will receive a copy of the message. The difference between
them is that the list of addresses in ``CC'' is included in
the message, while the ``BCC'' (blind carbon copy) addresses
will be suppressed in the message keeping them anonymous. If you enter
an address like ``#myfolder'', Mahogany will interpret it as
the name of a mailfolder and save a copy of the message to that folder
(in this case ``myfolder'').

Understanding program options</A>
</H1>

<P>
One of the goals of the Mahogany project is to be as configurable
as possible. Of course, it means that Mahogany has a lot of options
- however we hope that it doesn't make the program more difficult
to use because you have the complete liberty to ignore all options
until you need to use them. Moreover, some program options are completely
transparent to the user because they are automatically remembered
by the program. All the other ones may be changed from the main options
dialog which may be invoked from the main window toolbar or from the
menu. Generally, Mahogany configuration settings are inherited in
a logical fashion. The settings in the preferences dialog are the
global default settings and can be overridden on a per-folder basis.
Subfolders inherit from their parent folders. Currently there is no
full GUI support for this, but the next release will have the full
set of program options available on the per-folder basis. Currently
you can already achieve this by editing the configuration file manually.
Also, system administrators can provide other defaults in a global
/etc/Mahogany.conf file (also found in /usr/etc, /usr/local/etc, /opt/etc,
...).

These options include the sizes and the positions of all windows,
the texts of all prompts, the positions of splitters in the main program
window and the other folder views as well as several other things.
These options are special in that they do not appear in the options
dialog and so can not be changed directly - instead Mahogany remembers
them each time it is shut down, so when it is reopened it will be
in exactly the same state as during the last run. Try to play with
it: adjust the sizes of the main program window and the splitters
in it as you like, exit Mahogany and restart it (this is for testing
only, of course, you do not need to do it each time!) - you should
see that the window reappears on the same position (although this
might not work under some window managers), has the same size and
is split in the same manner.

when used together with your username.

<LI><B>Return/Reply address</B> 
<BR>
Here you can specify a return mail address where you want to receive
mail and replies to your mails from other users. By using this you
can hide your original (possibly ``uglier'') return address.

<LI><B>Return return address from To: field</B>
<BR>
If set, Mahogany will use the original <TT>To:</TT> address field
values for the <TT>Reply-To:</TT> header entry of any message replies
that you send. This makes sure that the same person sending you mail
will always see the same mail address for you. It is especially useful,
if you collect mail from several different incoming mail folders.
An example: Someone sends you mail to <TT>John.Doe@mycompany.com</TT>.
If you reply to this message, it will appear as coming from <TT>John.Doe@mycompany.org</TT>,
even if you read this mail from home, on a machine called <TT>MyBox.fun.org</TT>.
On the other hand, if someone sends you mail to <TT>MyAlias@writeme.com</TT>,
your reply will carry that as a return address, so that person will
never know about your <TT>mycompany.com</TT> office address.

These timeouts are used for all accesses to remote servers. Generally
it is a good idea to set them to small values to avoid unnecessary
delays if something goes wrong. On the other hand, you want to make
sure that they are long enough for slow connections, like for example
through a modem line. If you get a lot of error messages about failed
accesses to remote servers, you should try to increase these settings.

be loaded, the default XFace will be substituted.

<LI><B>Mail alias substring expansion</B>
<BR>
If enabled, the EXPAND button will search the mail address databases
using substring search rather than just comparing the text against
the beginning of addresses and aliases. Produces many more matches
than the default search and might take a bit longer.

<LI><B>Font family, font sizes, foreground colour, background colour</B>

These settings determine the appearance of the composition window's

Allows you to specify default values for the To:, CC: and BCC: fields
and whether to display them in the compose view or not. Hint: you
may want to configure the folder where you collect all messages from
some person (or the mailing list) to have this persons reply address
default value for the ``To:`` field.

It will be automatically remembered each time you exit Mahogany.

<LI><B>Poll for new mail delay</B>
<BR>
Mahogany will check all incoming mailboxes for new mail. Specify the
time between checks in seconds here. Notice that each check causes
a short delay as Mahogany polls the folders, set it to a longer value
to reduce the annoying screen updates, set it to a shorter value if
you care about receiving your new mail with little delay.

<LI><B>Ping/check folder interval in seconds</B>

be inconvenient if you want to just look at headers without downloading
messages over a slow link.

<LI><B>Threshold for displaying progress dialog</B>
<BR>
Mahogany will display progress dialogs when parsing mail folders or
querying servers. If the number of messages is less than this threshold
value, the progress dialog will be suppressed - play with this setting

When this option is set, any message that gets selected in the list
of messages will get pre-viewed automatically. If using a modem connection,
it makes sense to disable it, so messages will only get loaded and
pre-viewed when double-clicked upon or when the 'V' key is pressed.
By default, this is enabled, so that clicking on a message or pressing
the spacebar to select it, will also pre-view it.

<LI><B>Font family, font size, foreground colour, background colour,
colour for URLs, colour for header names, colour for header values</B>

These settings control the appearance of messages in the message viewer

a different colour for them, can highlight them. When the user clicks
on a URL, it will be opened in an external browser.

<LI><B>Inline graphics</B>
<BR>
If enabled, Mahogany will display images included as MIME content
in the message window. If disabled, images will be represented by
a filetype icon like any other MIME content.

<LI><B>Conversion graphics format</B>
<BR>
Mahogany uses an external conversion program (<A HREF="Manual.html#HelpersPage">1.7.2</A>)
for image formats which it does not support natively. Here you can
chose one of the natively supported formats to use for the conversion.
At present, the most reliable format appears to be XPM. If configured
properly and all libraries are available, Mahogany should support
XPM, PNG, JPEG and BMP. Notice that XPM files are extremely large,
so you might want to change this setting to one of the other formats. 

<LI><B>Support special fax mailers</B>
<BR>
This enables support for domains sending faxes by email, such as the
<A NAME="tex2html5"
 HREF="http://www.efax.com/">EFAX</A>
fax to email gateway.
Faxes are sent as MIME attachments and need treatment different from
normal images.

<LI><B>Domains sending faxes</B>
<BR>
This is a colon-separated list of domains sending faxes. All IMAGE/TIFF
or APPLICATION/OCTET-STREAM MIME content in mails coming from these
domains will be treated as TIFF-G3 faxes. Note that the strings in
this field do not need to be real domain names but are substrings
looked for in the sender's email address.

<LI><B>Maximum size of message</B>
<BR>
If you attempt to view a message larger than this limit, Mahogany
will prompt you for confirmation. This is to prevent you from accidentally
downloading large messages over a slow remote connection. Setting
it to 0 will disable this. The limit is not applied to mailfolder
files.

<LI><B>Maximum number of messages</B>
<BR>
If you open a folder with more than this limit of messages, Mahogany
will ask you whether you want to limit the amount of messages downloaded
(or partially downloaded). Again, this is to prevent you from accidentally
downloading huge numbers of messages over a slow remote connection.
Setting it to 0 disables this. It does not apply to mailfolder files.
Also, for NNTP connections, this might be triggered although there
could be less messages in the newsgroup, as at the time of testing
the number of unread messages is not know yet.

Mahogany may automatically remember all addresses from all e-mail
messages you receive (actually, only those which you read). This is
called <I>address autocollection</I> and, as almost any other feature
of Mahogany can be turned on and off as desired. In this page you
may choose whether you want to use this feature at all (it is on by
default) and, if so, where should be the autocollected addresses be
put and other settings. See the Addressbook section (<A HREF="Manual.html#AdressDatabase">1.8</A>)
for more information on Mahogany's built-in addressbook.

<P>

<UL><LI><B>Autocollect addresses</B>
<BR>
You may choose ``No'' to disable autocollecting addresses completely,
or choose ``Yes'' to always autocollect them. The remaining
option, ``Ask'', means that you will be presented with a message
box each time an address is about to be autocollected.

<LI><B>Address book to use</B>
<BR>
You may enter the path of the address book to use for autocollected
addresses. Although you may use any address book for this, it is probably
better to have a special address book for all autocollected addresses.
If the path name given here is an absolute one, it is used as is.
Otherwise, it is considered to be relative to your Mahogany directory.
For example, the default for this option is ``autocollect.adb''
and so the default autocollect book will be created in 
<BR>
$HOME/.M/<SMALL>AUTOCOLLECT.ADB</SMALL> 
<BR>
under Unix.

<LI><B>Ignore addresses without names</B>
<BR>
You may with to autocollect only addresses which have a full name
- in this case you should check this option. If it is off and the
address has no name, the first part of e-mail address (the one preceding
the '@' symbol) will be used instead of the name.

</UL>
In addition to its own built-in addressbook format, Mahogany also
supports the addressbook files of the BBDB addressbook used with Emacs
(see <A HREF="Manual.html#BBDB">1.8.3</A>). Some settings can be set here which apply only
to the BBDB addressbook support:

<P>

<UL><LI><B>Ignore entries without names</B>
<BR>
BBDB can store entries which have only an e-mail address with them,
but no name. If you set this option, Mahogany will discard such entries.

<LI><B>Generate unique aliases</B>
<BR>
Setting this option allows Mahogany to ensure that all aliases are
unique. If two entries have the same alias, one of them will be modified
to distinguish them. This is especially useful in conjuction with
the following option. If this option is set, reading in of BBDB addressbooks
is slowed down considerably. However, setting it once, then saving
the addressbook and disabling it, will make sure that all aliases
are unique without slowing down subsequent loading of the addressbook
the next time it is used.

<LI><B>Name for nameless entries</B>
<BR>
If Mahogany finds entries without a name and is not set to ignore
it, this name will be used for such entries. It can be combined with
the option to generate unique aliases.

<LI><B>Save on exit</B>
<BR>
As saving BBDB addressbook can potentially lead to some loss of information
in the original database file (BBDB and Mahogany support different
fields), you can choose whether you want Mahogany to automatically
save the data on exit or ask you for confirmation. Read section <A HREF="Manual.html#BBDB">1.8.3</A>

prefix it with ``xterm -e'' under Unix in order to open Lynx
in a separate window. For example, you may use <SMALL>XTERM -T </SMALL>L<SMALL>YNX
-E </SMALL>L<SMALL>YNX.</SMALL>

<LI><B>URL browser is Netscape</B>
<BR>
If the browser used to open URLs belongs to the family of Netscape
programs, tick this box. Instead of calling a new browser each time,
Mahogany will tell the already running Netscape process to load the
new URL. Also, don't forget to clear it if you use another browser
- otherwise it will fail to start up.

<LI><B>Help viewer</B>
<BR>
The program listed here will be used to view the online help system
in HTML format. Any simple HTML viewer can be used here.

<LI><B>Help viewer is Netscape</B>

If this option is on, it is enough to select (for example, by clicking
on it) a folder in the folder tree control in the main window to open
it in the integrated folder view. Double clicking the folder or choosing
``Open'' from the popup menu will open folder in a separate
window. This approach has a drawback of being a little slow with either
very big folders or on slow machines/network connections, so an alternative
way is to uncheck this checkbox. Then double clicking a folder will
be needed to open it in the integrated folder view - while ``Open''
popup menu item will still open it in a separate window.

Remote configuration synchronisation_4109_</A>
</H2>

<P>
Mahogany can automatically save a subset of its configuration settings
in a mailbox at program exit and automatically retrieve that information
the next time it is started up. This option becomes useful if you
are using the program from different systems, e.g. if sometimes from
the office and some other times from home over a dialup link. In this
case, you can save some settings in a special IMAP folder and tell
the program to use this for some of the settings. Like that, you can
share the program settings no matter from where you run Mahogany and
you do not need to manually adjust both configurations.

<P>
To use this option, first create a folder on an IMAP server. Do not
use a POP3 server, as the program cannot store information via POP3,
IMAP is required for this to work. Then, activate the ``Sync options
with remote server'' setting and choose which settings you wish
to share. Currently supported are:

<P>

<UL><LI><B>Sync Filter Rules</B>: This keeps the global list of all filter
rules synchronised via the IMAP folder. Very useful if you want to
use the same set of filter rules no matter where you run Mahogany.

<LI><B>Sync Identities</B>: This keeps the list of available identity
settings synchronised. Be careful: some things such as server settings
might cause problems if they are used on a machine with different
network settings.

<LI><B>Sync part of the folder tree</B>: This allows you to synchronise
a complete sub-tree of the mailbox/folder tree. Activate this and
pick a group of folders from the tree (Click on the [&gt;&gt;]
button to choose one.) and this tree of folders will be available
no matter from where you run Mahogany. Note: this only makes sense
if the folder group contains networked folders which are accessible
from both machines. It synchronises configuration information, not
folder contents. So you cannot access a mailbox file residing on one
machine via this mechanism, but you can share configuration entries
for remote mailboxes, such as IMAP, POP3 or newsgroups.

<P>
To edit the address book, open the address book editor. If the book
is already present in the address book tree on the left side of the
window, you may expand it (and any subgroups it might have) and start
editing immediately. If not, you must first add it to the tree by
choosing ``New..'' from the ``Book'' submenu or using
the corresponding toolbar button.

<P>
Generally speaking, there are several ways to perform the same action
in the address book editor:

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>.
<DD>use the menus: the commands for creating and deleting address book
entries are in the ``Edit'' menu, the corresponding commands
for the address books - in ``Book'' one.
<DT>.
<DD>use the toolbar: this may be more convenient because, depending on
the current position of the selected item in the tree it will propose
to create either an address book or an entry.
<DT>.
<DD>use keyboard: &lt;INSERT&gt; key creates a new entry or address book if
the current selection is the root of the tree, &lt;DELETE&gt; deletes an
item and &lt;Alt-ENTER&gt; brings up the ``Properties'' dialog.
</DL>
To edit the entry, simply select it in the tree. The data associated
to it is spread over several notebook pages - select the one which
contains the field you want to change and change it. If you want to
undo your changes, simply press ``Cancel'' at any moment - however,
this only works while you're editing the entry. As soon as you pass
to another one, all previous changes are saved and cannot be undone
any more. The changes are saved automatically when you select another
entry or close the address book editor - there is no special ``Save''
button.

<P>
To quickly move in the address book tree you may use either the ``Find''
or ``Go to'' dialogs (both available in the ``Find'' menu).
The first dialog allows you to find the entry by its contents while
the second one allows you to quickly go to the entry (in thecurrent
address book only) if you know its nickname. In the ``Find''
dialog you have several options to configure the search: it may be
either case sensitive or not (should ``mike'' match ``Mike''?)
and try to find only the whole string or just the substring of it
(should ``mik'' match ``Mike''?). You may also choose
among which fields should the search be done. You may choose as many
fields as you like (possibly all of them) but you must choose at least
one.

<P>
After you used the ``Find'' dialog once, you may choose the
``Find next'' menu item to go to the next address book entry
matching your search criterium (notice that a message in the status
bar will notify you about how many matches, if any, were found). Keep
hitting ``Find next'' until the search wraps to the beginning
(again, watch the status line for the message) or until you find the
entry you're looking for.

<A NAME="PalmADB"></A><I>Mahogany</I> does currently support reading of
Palm Addressbooks (referring to a ``Palm'' we mean the handheld
organizer Palm Pilot running PalmOS). For being able to do that it
is required to include the PalmOS-Module (see below). The support
of Palm Addressbooks is not yet fully implemented, as so far it is
only possible to download the addresses from the Palm and to display
them. Changing and uploading changed/new addresses to the Palm is
something we plan to add in the next release.

<P>
To display the Palm addressbook, create a new addressbook of type
``PalmOS''. You will be asked to put your Palm into the cradle
and to push the HotSync-button. After the download the addressbook
is accessible in read-only mode. Restarting <I>Mahogany</I> requires
to download the addressbook again.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00311000000000000000">
Introduction</A>
</H2>

<P>
<I>Mahogany</I> has an embedded Python interpreter, if compiled
with Python support enabled. Python is an object-oriented script language
which can be used to write scripts to be executed by <I>Mahogany</I>
or even to extend <I>Mahogany</I>'s functionality. Python scripts
have full access to all internal Mahogany data structures and objects.

<P>
A number of user definable callback functions are available. Scripts
have access to most objects living in Mahogany. Scripting can be disabled
in the Preferences dialog (see <A HREF="Manual.html#PythonOptions">1.7.2</A>).

<P>
Currently the scripting support is quite basic. If you are interested
in writing scripts and need additional callbacks or support for them
within <I>Mahogany</I>, please get in touch with the developers
who will be happy to add it.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00312000000000000000">
Initialisation </A>
</H2>

<P>
At startup, <I>Mahogany</I> will load a file called <TT>Minit.py</TT>
and call the <TT>Minit()</TT> function defined in there, without any
arguments.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00313000000000000000">
Callback Functions (Hooks)</A>
</H2>

<P>
There are a number of callbacks available which will be called from
different places within <I>Mahogany</I>. These are defined in the
header file <TT>Mcallbacks.h</TT>. The documentation of these callbacks
can be found in the Classes documentation(<A NAME="tex2html6"
 HREF="classes/index.html">Classes online docs</A>).
All of these callbacks are called with at least two arguments:

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>.
<DD>The name of the hook for which the function got called, e.g. <TT>FolderOpenHook</TT>
<DT>.
<DD>A pointer to the object from which it was called. E.g. for <TT>FolderOpenHook</TT>,
this would be a pointer to a <TT>MailFolder</TT> object. This object
does not carry a useable type with it and needs to be converted in
the callback, e.g. if the argument is called <TT>arg</TT> and the
object is a <TT>MailFolder</TT>, the object must either be used as
<TT>MailFolder.MailFolder(arg)</TT> or be converted as <TT>mf
= MailFolder.MailFolder(arg)</TT>. 
<DT>.
<DD>Some callbacks have a third argument. This is either a single value
or a tuple holding several values.
</DL>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00314000000000000000">

<P>
To avoid repeatedly typing in the name of the module (<TT>MailFolder</TT>

By default modules are not imported into the global namespace and

Introduction</A>

<P>
Starting with release 0.5, <I>Mahogany</I> allows the use of plugins
(modules). This allows for an easy and comfortable way to enlarge
<I>Mahogany</I>´s functionality. These modules can be loaded at runtime
and do not need to be part of the main executable. At the time of
release 0.5 we are still linking them statically, but they can be
loaded dynamically and future releases are likely to use this feature
to keep the size of the main executable down.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00322000000000000000">
The Filters Module</A>
</H2>

<P>
This module provides a filtering language for Mahogany. It allows
you to have Mahogany look at different message properties, such as
message contents, size or header lines and execute arbitrary action
on them. The most common use would be to sort mails from different
mailing lists in corresponding mailfolders, to reduce the number of
messages in your main incoming mailbox. Filters can be specified in
three possible ways:

<P>

<UL><LI>You can use the filters dialog. This is the most convenient and best
supported option.

<LI>You can write them by hand, using a simple programming language remotely
similar to 'C', and put the filtering rules directly into the Mahogany
configuration file or registry.

<LI>You can write complex rules yourself, save them to a file and tell
Mahogany to read the rules from that file.

</UL>
The normal way to set up filters is to specify them in the filters
dialog (<A HREF="Manual.html#FiltersDialog">2.2.2</A>) and then tell Mahogany folder which
of the filter rules to use for the individual folders with athe folder
filters dialog (<A HREF="Manual.html#FolderFiltersDialog">2.2.2</A>).

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00322100000000000000"></A><A NAME="FiltersDialog"></A>
<BR>
The Filters Dialog_4260_
</H3>

<P>
This dialog allows you to define any number of filter rules available
to Mahogany. In a seaparate dialog (<A HREF="Manual.html#FolderFiltersDialog">2.2.2</A>) you
can then pick any rule from the list and assign it to a folder. As
you can have different sets of rules for each folder and might want
to share rules for some folders, this dialog simply sets up rules
and you can later specify for which folders to use them. When editing
or adding a new filter rule, you will get to the following dialog:

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00322200000000000000">
The Filter-Rule Dialog_4261_</A>
</H3>

<P>
This dialog allows you to set up or edit an individual filtering rule,
it contains of the following components:

<P>

<UL><LI>The rule name, in the text entry field at the very top. This name
is only to help you remember what the rule does and will appear in
the list of rules in the main Filters Dialog, but is without any further
significance.

<LI>Underneath the name, you find the text ``If Message...'' followed
by at least one row of conditioncontrols.

<LI>Under the condition controls you find the text ``Then do this:``
followed by some action controls.

</UL>
You can add more pattern matching controls by pressing the [More]
button, and you can delete the last pattern matching rule by pressing
the [Less] button. The number of actions to execute is fixed to
one.

<P>
You can use several condition and connect them via logical AND and
OR, optionally negating them by ticking the [Not] box. The following
conditions can be tested for at present:

<P>

<UL><LI>Always - this rule will always be executed

<LI>Contains - check if the text next to it is contained in the message
component selected

<LI>Match - check if the message component selected is exactly this text
(case independent)

<LI>Match Case - check if the message compent selected is exactly this
text (case dependent)

<LI>Match RegExp - check if the message compent selected matches the regular
expression specified

<LI>Larger Than - check if the message is larger than this in KByte

<LI>Smaller Than - check if the message is smaller than this in KByte

<LI>Older Than - check if the message is older than this many days

<LI>Newer Than - check if the message is newer than this many days

<LI>Is SPAM - check if the message originates from a system blacklisted
as sending unsolicited emails (SPAM). 

<LI>Python - execute the text in the box in the built-in Python interpreter
and proceed if it returns a non-0 result.

</UL>
The possible actions which can be performed, are:

<P>

<UL><LI>Delete - deletes the message

<LI>Copy to - copies the message to the folder specified

<LI>Move to - moves the message to the folder specified

<LI>Expunge - expunge all messages in this folder

<LI>MessageBox - open a message box dialog with the text specified

<LI>LogEntry - add the text specified to the log window

<LI>Python - execute the text specified in the built-in Python interpreter

</UL>
If you are not using a Trash folder, it is a good idea to add a rule
at the end of the list of filtering rules, that always expunges all
messages. For testing filters, you can leave that rule disabled, an
all messages will get treated and marked as deleted, but stay around.
Only when expunge is executed, will they really disappear in the original
mailbox. Notice, if you are using a Trash folder, this does not apply,
as messages won't be marked as deleted but moved straight to Trash.

The Folder Filters dialog_4262_
</H3>

<P>
This dialog allows you to assign filter rules to a folder. You can
pick them from the set of existing filter rules (set up via the Filters
Dialog (<A HREF="Manual.html#FiltersDialog">2.2.2</A>)) and change the order of the rules.
The listbox on the left lists the existing filtering rules for the
currently selected folder in the order in which they are executed.
You can use the buttons to change the order or rules. You can also
activate/deactivate rules by clicking on the litte checkbox ([X]
or [ ]) next to their name. 

<P>
If you want to apply rules to all incoming messages and are collecting
mail from different servers, simply apply the rules to the ``New
Mail'' folder if you have one, alternatively you can set up rules
for individual servers or INBOX.

The PalmOS Module</A>
</H2>

<P>
When 3Com released its first PalmPilots several years ago, many people
did not believe in a success. But they were proven wrong, the Palm
Pilot (or short: Palm) is today the most used handheld organizer. 

<P>
For all the people possessing one of those´s little helpers, the PalmOS
Module allows (or will allow) for an easy integration of the Palm´s
data in Mahogany. In future releases there will be full support for
addressbook synching, schedules etc. Currently you can only view the
Palm´s addressbook (see above) and use <I>Mahogany</I> as your Palm
desktop software.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00323100000000000000">
Desktop functionality</A>
</H3>

<P>
As there is not really a common Palm desktop in the Unix/Linux environment
(not like under MS Windows), we thought it a nice idea to include
the desktop into <I>Mahogany</I>. Therefore <I>Mahogany</I> does allow
to

<P>

<UL><LI>create backups of the Palm´s databases using the ``Backup''
function

<LI>restore the previously backup-ed databases using the ``Restore''
function

<LI>install new files to the Palm using the ``Install'' function

</UL>
To use this functionality, you must of course have the PalmOS module
enabled. You can access the functions via the Plugin menu. In addition
to the above mentioned tasks, you can specify quite a lot of options
to adapt for instance the backup process to your personal needs. 

<P>
There is an additional function not mentioned yet, labelled ``Synchronize''.
Via the configuration dialog you can specify what should happen during
synchronization - starting with mail exchange, backups and automatic
installations. Read the following section about the configuration
dialog to get see how you can customize your PalmOS-Module.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00323200000000000000">
The configuration dialog_10011_</A>
</H3>

<P>
You can configure the PalmOS module via the Plugin menu in a lot of
ways. Let´s go through every single item in the configuration dialog
which you can access using the Plugin-Menu:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>l</STRONG>
<DD>When you have this enabled, you can specify a mailbox
which will be used as place of exchange for mails. Mails in this folder
will be transfered to the Palm at the next hotsync and the outbox
of the Palm´s mail program will be send. This mailbox is also used
as a configuration setting for messages sent. <I>Mahogany</I> will
use the properties of this mailbox when sending the messages retrieved
from the Palm's Outbox. If you have enabled the ``advanced user''
option in the program preferences' identity tab, you can set up a
separate return-address or completely different options for this mailbox
and therefore have the mail sent from the PalmPilot with different
settings as those sent normally. The options for user name and return
address as set on the Palm are ignored when mails are sent with <I>Mahogany</I>.
<DT><STRONG>e</STRONG>
<DD>Enter here the name of the mailbox that should
be used for mail exchange when you have the ``Synchronise Mail''
feature enabled (see above).
<DT><STRONG>e</STRONG>
<DD>This specifies what to do with outgoing e-mails
retrieved from the PalmPilot and sent. You have three options: 

<P>

<UL><LI>file : move messages from Outbox to Filed mailbox on the Palm

<LI>delete : delete messages after sending

<LI>keep : keep messages in Palm's Outbox

</UL>
<DT><STRONG>p</STRONG>
<DD>Setting this checkbox to true will make a backup
take place every time you ``Synchronize''.
<DT><STRONG>s</STRONG>
<DD>This field does contain a valid directory
path where the PalmOS-Module will store the backup of your Palm´s
databases.
<DT><STRONG>s</STRONG>
<DD>This checkbox determines whether
you want files to be deleted on the PC that are residing in the backup
directory but are not any longer on the Palm. This makes it possible
to really keep the backup identical to the Palm, but has the disadvantage
that you might loose data if you (accidently?) delete important data
on the Palm and do a backup, as the backup-ed databases will be deleted
too. So think carefully whether you do really want to do this.
<DT><STRONG>y</STRONG>
<DD>Enable this checkbox if you only
want to make an incremental backup. Using this features will speed
the backup process up, as only changed or new databases are downloaded
from the Palm.
<DT><STRONG>s</STRONG>
<DD>Enabling this checkbox will make the PalmOS-Module
ignore the backup flags of the databases. By default the PalmOS-Module
does only backup files with a set backup flag. Use this option if
you want all files to be backup´ed.
<DT><STRONG>s</STRONG>
<DD>Here you can specify a comma separated
list of databases (without spaces!) that should not be backup´ed. 
<DT><STRONG>l</STRONG>
<DD>Using this feature enables the auto-install feature
and everytime you ``Synchronize'' the module will check the
auto-install directory for Palm databases. If databases are found
they will be installed and deleted without further notice!
<DT><STRONG>y</STRONG>
<DD>Specify here a directory where the files
to be auto-installed can be found.
</DL>
Besides that, some general options are available:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>e</STRONG>
<DD>Here you can specify the device where the Pilot is
residing (this ought to be /dev/pilot under Unix/Linux and Com1: or
Com2: under MS Windows (not yet supported)).
<DT><STRONG>d</STRONG>
<DD>You have the choice beetween different hotsync
speeds (``connection speed''), measured in baud. 
<DT><STRONG>e</STRONG>
<DD>You can force a lock of the above set device
by enabling ``Try to lock device''
</DL>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00323300000000000000">
Accessing the Palms</A>
</H3>

<P>
There is the ``general'' approach to get the Palm databases
on your computer and the more selective one. For the first one, just
use the ``Synchronize'' menu point in the plugin menu. Depending
on what you have enabled in the configuration dialog (see above),
different actions will be taken (backup, mail exchange, ...).

<P>
If you only want to update your backup or to install a file or to
restore your Palm´s contents, you can access these functions individually
by using the corresponding menu points in the plugin menu.

on a slow partition such as a network disk (NFS), the startup time
can be reduced just by moving it elsewhere and creating a link to
it from /.M directory.

Limiting Amount of Data Transferred
</H2>

<P>
When using a remote server, especially over a slow link (such as a
modem), it may be undesirable to automatically retrieve all messages
from the server. Mahogany provides several options to help you with
limiting the amount of data transferred.

<P>
First, you should probably disable the ``Open folder at single
click'' and ``Preview message when selected'' options from
the ``Message View'' and ``Miscellaneous'' pages of the
options dialog to avoid accidentally open a folder or a message.

<P>
Second, there are several useful settings in the ``Folders''
page. Note that they can be set for each folder separately so you
can only choose to change the default values for some slow servers
but keep the original values for all the other ones. These options
allow you to specify a threshold for message size: before downloading
a message of size bigger than the specified (in Kb), you will be asked
for the confirmation. They also allow to set a similar threshold for
the number of message headers retrieved: you will be asked before
retrieving more than the specified number of headers (default is 100)
from server. This limit is called ``soft limit'' and there is,
of course, also a ``hard'' one which can be set in the same
page. The hard limit, if set (it has value 0, i.e. disabled, by default)
says that at most that many message headers will be downloaded. Unlike
the soft limit, it is unconditional and no questions will be asked
if it is exceeded.

<P>
The hard limit is mostly useful for ``write only'' folders,
such as SentMail. Indeed, Mahogany accesses it very often (each time
a message is sent) and it quickly grows big resulting in delays after
message sending. Unconditionally limiting the number of messages retrieved
from the server helps a lot in this situation.

All Mahogany icons show a questionmark</A>
</H2>

<P>
<I>I'm a linuxuser (redhat) who just found Mahogany and really
likes it, but I have a problem, I cant get all the widgets to work,
the pictures on the buttons and the ones before the mailboxes all
appear as an questionmark. Do I need some library to make it look
like your screenshot? If you would assist me in this matter I would
be very grateful.</I>

<P>
It depends how you installed it. If the icon with the questionmark
appears, it means that Mahogany didn't find its installation directory
with the icons. If you installed the linux version from the .tar.gz
with the binary, it should go into /usr/local or a similar place and
you should have the icons in /usr/local/share/M/icons. If they are
not there, Mahogany cannot find them. If you have installed it in
a different location, Mahogany should ask you for the installation
(&#34;global Mahogany directory&#34;) when you start it
for the first time.

<P>
If you have compiled it yourself, make sure you do a &#34;make
install&#34; or &#34;make install_all&#34; (of which
parts might fail, depending on your setup), to install everything
in the right place. If you just grabbed the binary of the daily snapshot,
you need to have a working Mahogany installation as well or it won't
get the icons. You do not need any additional library, Mahogany handles
xpm files internally.

How do I unpack the compressed files?</A>
</H2>

<P>
The distribution files for Solaris and some of the other ones, are
in compressed tar format, having the ending <TT>.tar.gz</TT> . To
unpack them, you need <TT>gzip</TT> and <TT>tar</TT>. Change to the
directory where you want to install Mahogany, e.g to <TT>/usr</TT>
or <TT>/opt</TT> or <TT>/usr/local</TT> and issue the following command: 

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>gzip -dc &lt; thedistributionfile | tar xvof -</TT>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
Where <TT>thedistributionfile</TT> is the complete path to the file
you downloaded. You will need to have proper write access to the directory
where you install it and <TT>tar</TT> should show you a list of all
files being installed as it unpacks them.

Compiling aborts with errors</A>
</H2>

<P>
<A NAME="CompileErrors"></A>A common problem with compiling wxGTK and Mahogany
is, that you need to follow the instructions in Mahogany's README
file and use the configure script to set them up as explained. If
you use different arguments for configure than those shown in README,
things will not work! Also, before running configure again, remove
any *.cache and *status files in the working directory or configure
will re-use some old settings.

<P>
Also, as we are omitting some unused subdirectories from the wxGTK
source, to save you download time, you may need to run ``make -k''
rather than just ``make'' to get it to ignore some errors caused
by this. On non-Linux/GNU systems, you need to use the GNU linker,
i.e. ``gmake'' rather than the default ``make''.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00613100000000000000">
make fails</A>
</H3>

<P>
If Mahogany's own make process fails after configuring it, this is
likely caused by the ``make depend'' stage. Simply run ``make
-i depend'' from the toplevel (mahogany-0.50) directory and it
will run through, ignoring all errors. After that, a normal ``make''
will succeed.

Mahogany fails to find wxWindows, Configure fails</A>

The following steps should identify and solve the problem:

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>.
<DD>Do a &#34;make install&#34; for wxWindows and watch the
output, it should copy lots of things to /usr/local/....
<DT>.
<DD>Do a &#34;which wx-config&#34;, it should report wx-config
to be in /usr/local/bin
<DT>.
<DD>Just type &#34;wx-config -cflags&#34;, it should run the
wx-config script and report the compiler flags, which should include
something like &#34;-I/usr/local/include&#34;.
<DT>.
<DD>Then go to the Mahogany directory and &#34;rm *cache*&#34;
to remove old configuration info and run ./configure
<DT>.
<DD>This *should* find wx/wx.h if all of the above worked, if not,
look at the end of config.log to see what went wrong.
<DT>.
<DD>If it does not find the wxWindows library, you need to add /usr/local/lib
to either your LD_LIBRARY_PATH or to /etc/ld.conf (and run ldconfig
as root), then remove *cache* and try again. Again, if something
fails, look at config.log.

The Preferences Dialog does not show up properly</A>
</H2>

<P>
<I>When I set up Mahogany or select the preferences dialog, its
contents do not appear. Sometimes I cannot enter anything in the fields.</I>

<P>
wxGTK has a problem with constraint handling which can cause this
dialog to sometimes get into an endless loop trying to do the layout.
On most windowmanagers it helps if you resize the dialog a little
and it will appear correctly. This seems to depend on the platform
and windowmanager. Also, wxGTK does not seem to work correctly with
OpenLook which does not allow you to enter anything.

You should be able to right-click on the folder treecontrol on the

Make it of type &#34;file&#34; and specify the path to the

Mahogany will not work properly when executed by the <TT>root</TT>

the program will not be able to create some files needed. For security

Does Mahogany have group aliases?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Mahogany supports alias expansion for individual entries and for groups.
There are two ways in which you can expand an alias to a group of
addresses:

<P>

<UL><LI>The quick and dirty approach: Create an addressbook entry and simply
list multiple, comma separated, addresses in its Email field. Mahogany
will use the whole contents of this field when expanding aliases. 

<LI>The more elegant method: Create a new group in your addressbook and
add the individual addresses as sub-entries of this group. If you
use the group name as a mail alias, Mahogany will expand it to the
list of email addresses of all of its group members. This is more
powerful, as you can easily add and remove entries to sub groups.

Mahogany allows you to have as many folders or mail accounts as you
like. That's why it doesn't ask you at the beginning. To add a POP
account: 

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>.
<DD>right click on the folder tree and choose &#34;Create Folder&#34;

How can I set up IMAP access?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Follow the rules for setting up POP3 access<A HREF="Manual.html#POP3">5.2.5</A> but set the
folder type to be ``IMAP folder''. Then enter the name of your
IMAP server, your username and password (or leave it empty to be asked
later) for that server and, optionally, the path to the folder on
the IMAP server. You can leave the path empty, and it will use the
default folder (INBOX).

<P>
If you want to access many IMAP folders on the same server, or a directory
there, you can create foldertree entries representing the IMAP server
itself (i.e. the top-level directory on it) or a directory on the
IMAP server. For these, if not using the Wizard dialog, make sure
that the folder properties dialog has the ``is directory'' checkbox
ticked, which tells Mahogany that it is not a mailbox file to open,
but a directory which can be browsed for entries via the popup menu.

<I>Can I access multiple different POP3 or IMAP accounts?</I>

<P>
Yes, <I>Mahogany</I> allows you to have any number of different
folders configured. Just right-click on the folder tree control and
choose the ``Create Folder...'' option from the popup-menu.
You can then switch between the different folders by selecting them
(usually with a double-click on the tree control) for display in the
main window, or, by selecting ``Open'' from the popup-menu which
will open the folders in their own individual windows.

<P>
You can also select the ``Collect all mail from this folder''

popup-menu option) to let <I>Mahogany</I> automatically check these
accounts for new mail and collect it from there.

Yes, you can set almost *all* options on a per-folder basis, including
your name or return address, even outgoing SMTP servers to make it

Can I run Mahogany as root?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<I>Very simple question: can I run Mahogany on a unix system
as the superuser (root)?</I>

<P>
Not directly. There are two problems with it:

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>.
<DD>It is not a good idea for security reasons. In fact, you should not
even run X11 as root. Though, we would not dare to impose that on
you, if you want to, that is your problem.
<DT>.
<DD>The technical reason, and this is why Mahogany does not allow it:
The c-client library that we use for accessing mail folders and servers
uses the user-Id 0 (root) internally and does not work when called
as root. When inquiring why this is so, c-client's author told us
that it was bad to read mail as root - he thinks he knows what is
good for you. Unless we find an easy way to circumvent that problem,
you will not be able to run Mahogany as root as we have no time and
desire to re-write the c-client library just for this.
</DL>
There is a workaround however:

<P>
You can forward your email to another user, say ``<TT>user1</TT>'',
by creating a <TT>/root/.forward</TT> file containing that user's
name. Then, run Mahogany through the ``<TT>su</TT>'' command:
``<TT>su user1 -c mahogany</TT>''. This will work just fine.
If you get an error message about it being unable to access your X11
display, do a ``<TT>xhost localhost</TT>'' before, which will
allow all local users to access your display. All this is not very
safe from a security point of view if you don't trust your local machine,
but perfectly fine for standalone or dialup boxes.

Simple, press '#' or 'x' or select Message/Expunge from the menu.

one as all other folders will move messages straight to Trash instead
