1. Unix
-------

 We don't provide binary RPMs for this version, however it is possible to
easily build them from the provided SRPM. We do provide unofficial binary
packages for Ubuntu Linux Dapper, please add the line

   deb http://apt.tt-solutions.com/ubuntu/ dapper main

to /etc/apt/sources.list file of your Ubuntu system to be able to
"apt-get install mahogany".


 For the other systems, please build the program from sources yourself as
described in the INSTALL file. . If you are going to do this, you may need to
download the prebuilt Mdocs.tar.gz file if your system doesn't have all the
tools needed to build the documentation (LaTeX, makeindex, dvips, ps2pdf
and latex2html).

2. Win32
--------

 Do *not* uninstall the previous version Mahogany before installing
this version if you want to keep your old settings. Install the
program into the same directory if you wish to keep the old system
folders (such as SentMail and NewMail) as well.
