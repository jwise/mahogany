Release notes for Mahogany 0.65
=====================================================================

0. General
----------

The binary distribution contains the version of Mahogany compiled
with SSL support but without Python support. To use the latter you
should recompile the program from sources yourself.

Please remember that you can always ask about any problems you have
on our mailing list:

1. Unix
-------

 The provided binary RPM are for x86 RedHat 8/9 systems, if you use
another system or architecture please rebuild the RPM from the source
RPM.

 Of course, you can always build the program from sources yourself as
well. If you are going to do this, you may need to download the
prebuilt Mdocs.tar.gz file if your system doesn't have all the tools
needed to build the documentation (LaTeX, makeindex, dvips, ps2pdf
and latex2html).

2. Win32
--------

 Do *not* uninstall the previous version Mahogany before installing
this version if you want to keep your old settings. Install the
program into the same directory if you wish to keep the old system
folders (such as SentMail and NewMail) as well.
