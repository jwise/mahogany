Release notes for Mahogany 0.63:
=====================================================================

1. Unix
-------

 The provided binary RPM are for x86 RedHat 7.0 systems, if you use
another system or architecture please rebuild the RPM from the source
RPM.

 Of course, you can always build the program from sources yourself as
well. If you are going to do this, you may need to download the
prebuilt Mdocs.tar.gz file if your system doesn't have all the tools
needed to build the documentation (LaTeX, makeindex, dvips, ps2pdf
and latex2html).

2. Win32
--------

 Do *not* uninstall Mahogany 0.62 before installing this version if
you want to keep your old settings. Install the program into the same
directory if you wish to keep the old system folders (such as
SentMail and NewMail) as well.

 Last minute note: it seems that the installer doesn't overwrite the
existing M.exe file when installing into the same directory, please
delete/rename it manually before the installation to avoid problems.
