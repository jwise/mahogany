Announcing Mahogany Version 0.65
====================================================================

Mahogany is an OpenSource(TM) cross-platform mail news client. It is
available for X11/Unix and MS Windows platforms and supports many of
the Internet protocols and standards, including POP3, IMAP4
(and the secure versions using SSL), SMTP and NNTP. Mahogany also
supports MIME and many common Unix mailbox formats (including MBX,
MBOX and MH).

The main "selling points" of Mahogany in our opinion are:

* Cross-platform: use the same client to access your email from
  all the machines you use, share the settings between them.

* Everything is configurable: all aspects of the program behaviour
  may be changed by the user, yet you don't have to spend any time
  doing it before starting to use the program which is completely
  plug-and-play - but you can fit it to your needs later.

* High quality IMAP4 support: Mahogany is first and foremost an IMAP
  client and, although it does support POP3, it uses all the
  IMAP-only features (on demand message and attachment retrieval,
  server side messages copying/moving and also sorting/threading if
  available) and doesn't just consider IMAP as another kind of POP
  server.

* Open to the world: Mahogany integrates well with the other programs
  (be it your WWW browser or an editor) and doesn't lock the user in
  proprietary formats, but uses the standard ones whenever possible.

* Full featured: some of the features not yet mentioned are: modern
  GUI, built-in filters using a real programming language (but also
  GUI support for creating them without learning it), message
  templates, multiple identities, support for calendar plugin,
  powerful and flexible address book (with vCard support),
  synchronization with Palm, built-in HTML viewer, X-Face support,
  support for receiving faxes sent via EFax and much more.

Acknowledgements
=====================================================================

Mahogany is written using the OpenSource wxWindows framework for GUI
C++ applications, building on the GTK+ toolkit on Unix and native
Win32 API under Windows. The imap-2000 (c-client) library developed
by University of Washington is used for mail folder access. We also
use OpenSSL for SSL support and compface for X-Face support. We wish
to thank all the people whose work has made writing Mahogany much
simpler (and even possible at all)!

Changes Since Release 0.64
=====================================================================

Key changes are:

* messages may be postponed and are saved in case of crash/interrupt
* added (START)TLS support for POP/IMAP/SMTP/NNTP
* limited support for reading PGP signed/encrypted messages
* viewer filters (*bold*, _italic_, signature highlihting, ...)
* built-in configurable SPAM filters
* search for messages in multiple folders

Some of new features:

* new "Migrate" tool for account migration
* new commands: "Move Folder", "Resent Message", "Bounce",
  "Follow-up to Newsgroup", "Jump to Message #"
* UTF-7 support
* Mahogany process may be controlled remotely
* composer templates are now more powerful

Other noticeable improvements:

* composer allows to edit the attachment properties
* popup menus for the URLs in the message viewer
* find dialog in the message viewer

Important bug fixes:

* too many to be listed here, but if you had experienced (fatal)
  problems with a previous Mahogany version, it should be fixed now


Please see the CHANGES file in the distribution for an even more
detailed list of changes.


 Hoping you will enjoy Mahogany!
