Announcing Mahogany Version 0.63
=====================================================================

Mahogany is an OpenSource(TM) cross-platform mail and news client. It
is available for X11/Unix and MS Windows platforms, supporting a wide
range of protocols and standards, including POP3, IMAP4 and full MIME
support as well as secure communications via SSL. Mahogany also
supports many Unix mailbox formats (MBX, MBOX, MH) and can be
extended even further using its built-in Python interpreter and/or
its loadable modules (plug-ins).

Mahogany includes an extendable address book system supporting
hierarchical organisation of entries, group aliases, searching the
database and easy editing, with support for other programs' address
database formats. Currently Mahogany's native format, (X)Emacs' BBDB
address books and PalmOS address books are supported. LDAP support is
planned for future versions.

Mahogany's wealth of features and ease of use make it one of the most
powerful clients available, providing a consistent and intuitive
interface across all supported platforms and an ideal GUI email
client for advanced and novice users alike.

Mahogany is written using the OpenSource wxWindows framework for GUI
C++ applications, building on the GTK+ toolkit on Unix and native
Win32 API under Windows and imap-2000 (c-client) library developed by
University of Washington for mail folder access.

Mahogany is constantly being tested on a variety of Linux systems,
Solaris-sparc and MS Windows. It should compile and work on any
modern Unix platform and any Win32 version.

Changes Since Release 0.62
=====================================================================

Key changes are:

 - huge speed optimizations, especially for IMAP users
 - several fatal bugs fixed (mainly in Win32 version)

New features:

 - show the number of messages in the folder tree
 - "Clear folder" to delete all messages without opening a folder
 - added "away" or "unattended" mode
 - added "Close" and "Close all" folders commands

Improvements:

 - passwords can now be encrypted using TwoFish under Win32 as well
 - URL popup menu in the message viewer
 - "open URL in new browser window" option
 - Python 2.x is now supported and not only 1.5 (Unix)
 - option to automatically select the units for message size (kb/mb)
 - added "Sender" option

Bug fixes:

 - fixed server side searching (IMAP only)
 - fixed text highlighting when selecting text in the viewer
 - renaming of the folders in the tree fixed once again

Please see the CHANGES file in the distribution for an even more
detailed list of changes.

Future Plans
=====================================================================

We are going to continue on optimizing Mahogany and the next version
should be much faster as the message headers will be retrieved on
demand only and, optionally, cached locally. The speed optimization
is the main focus of development for 0.64. The new features we are
also working on are:

 - improving the message editor (work in progress)
 - full HTML message editing/displaying (almost complete)
 - Unicode (UTF7/8) support (mostly done)

Next we hope to implement the following:

 - multi-threading to allow network operations to happen in
   background
 - PGP/GPG support
 - LDAP support

Please direct any queries to mahogany-users@lists.sourceforge.net
and don't hesitate to contact us if you would like to participate
in Mahogany development!

Known bugs:
-----------

*** Please note that Mahogany/UNIX is officially in beta state while
*** Mahogany/Win32 is still considered to be in alpha stage (although
*** we use both versions on the daily basis).

There are always some, listed on our bugtracker at
http://mahogany.sourceforge.net/bugz/ and we are working on them.

 Hoping you will find Mahogany useful,

M dev-team
