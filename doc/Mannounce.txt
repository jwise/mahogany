Announcing Mahogany Version 0.67
====================================================================

Mahogany is an OpenSource(TM) cross-platform mail news client. It is
available for X11/Unix and MS Windows platforms and supports many of
the Internet protocols and standards, including POP3, IMAP4
(and the secure versions using SSL), SMTP and NNTP. Mahogany also
supports MIME and many common Unix mailbox formats (including MBX,
MBOX and MH). Finally, Mahogany can be extended even further using
the built-in Python interpreter.

The main "selling points" of Mahogany in our opinion are:

* Cross-platform: use the same client to access your email from
  all the machines you use, share the settings between them.

* Everything is configurable: all aspects of the program behaviour
  may be changed by the user, yet you don't have to spend any time
  doing it before starting to use the program which is completely
  plug-and-play - but you can fit it to your needs later.

* High quality IMAP4 support: Mahogany is first and foremost an IMAP
  client and, although it does support POP3, it uses all the
  IMAP-only features (on demand message and attachment retrieval,
  server side messages copying/moving and also sorting/threading if
  available) and doesn't just consider IMAP as another kind of POP
  server.

* Open to the world: Mahogany integrates well with the other programs
  (be it your WWW browser or an editor) and doesn't lock the user in
  proprietary formats, but uses the standard ones whenever possible.

* Full featured: some of the features not yet mentioned are: modern
  GUI, built-in filters using a real programming language (but also
  GUI support for creating them without learning it), message
  templates, multiple identities, support for calendar plugin,
  powerful and flexible address book (with vCard support),
  synchronization with Palm, built-in HTML viewer, X-Face support,
  support for receiving faxes sent via EFax and much more.

Acknowledgements
=====================================================================

Mahogany is written using the OpenSource wxWindows framework for GUI
C++ applications, building on the GTK+ toolkit on Unix and native
Win32 API under Windows. The imap-2000 (c-client) library developed
by University of Washington is used for mail folder access. We also
use OpenSSL for SSL support and compface for X-Face support. We wish
to thank all the people whose work has made writing Mahogany much
simpler (and even possible at all)!

Changes Since Release 0.65
=====================================================================

Key changes are:

* new, more usable, composer
* embedded Python interpreter works again
* working Mac OS X version

Some of new features:

* several convenient new commands: quick search ('/', '?'), "Paste
  quoted", "Select all"
* viewer improvements: text one now supports printing, HTML viewer
  supports selection
* better support for UTF-7/8 encoded headers
* new template variable ($header)
* new filter function (isfromme())

Other noticeable improvements:

* better crash reporting in Win32 builds
* and, of course, many bug fixes, as usual


Please see the CHANGES file in the distribution for an even more
detailed list of changes.


 Hoping you will enjoy Mahogany!
