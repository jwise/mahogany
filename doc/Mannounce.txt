A new release of Mahogany has been made.
Binaries for Linux-x86-glibc2.0 and source are available immediately,
binaries for Solaris and Linux-axp as well as RedHat rpm  and Debian
deb packages are following soon.

Announcing Mahogany Version 0.22a 
===================================================================== 

Mahogany is an OpenSource(TM) cross-platform mail and news client. It
is available for X11/Unix and MS Windows platforms, supporting a wide
range of protocols and standards, including POP3, IMAP and full MIME
support. Thanks to its built-in Python interpreter it can be extended
far beyond its original functionality.

Mahogany's wealth of features and ease of use make it one of the most
powerful clients available, providing a consistent and intuitive
interface across all supported platforms.

It aims at supporting GNOME (and KDE for that matter) and includes an
extendable address book system supporting hierarchical organisation of
entries, group aliases, searching the database and easy editing, with
support for other program`s address database formats. Currently
Mahogany`s native format and (X)Emacs` BBDB address books are
supported.

Mahogany is being developed using the free wxWindows application
framework, building on the GTK+ toolkit on Unix.

Mahogany is constantly being tested on Linux-x86, Linux-alpha,
Solaris-sparc and MS Windows. It should compile and work on any major
Unix platform. A binary release for MS Windows will follow soon.
