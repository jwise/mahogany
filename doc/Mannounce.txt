A new release of the `Mahogany' e-Mail and News client has been made.
=====================================================================

Source and binaries for a variety of Linux and Unix systems as well
as binaries for Win32 are available at

     http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3100

You can also get to the download page starting from

                  http://mahogany.sourceforge.net/

NB: My sincere excuses to all people who have written me asking for
    Win32 binaries and to whom I couldn't reply because there were
    so many of them. For personal reasons I couldn't make the Win32
    version as soon as I hoped to.

1. Announcing Mahogany Version 0.62
2. Changes Against the Previous Release

Announcing Mahogany Version 0.62
=====================================================================

Mahogany is an OpenSource(TM) cross-platform mail and news client. It
is available for X11/Unix and MS Windows platforms, supporting a wide
range of protocols and standards, including POP3, IMAP4 and full MIME
support as well as secure communications via SSL. Mahogany can be
extended far beyond its original functionality using its built-in
Python interpreter and/or its loadable modules (plug-ins).

Mahogany's wealth of features and ease of use make it one of the most
powerful clients available, providing a consistent and intuitive
interface across all supported platforms and an ideal GUI email client
for advanced and novice users alike.

Mahogany includes an extendable address book system supporting
hierarchical organisation of entries, group aliases, searching the
database and easy editing, with support for other programs' address
database formats. Currently Mahogany's native format, (X)Emacs' BBDB
address books and PalmOS address books are supported. LDAP support is
planned for future versions.

Mahogany is written using the OpenSource wxWindows application
framework for GUI C++ applications, building on the GTK+ toolkit on
Unix and native Win32 API under Windows and imap-2000 (c-client)
library developed by University of Washington for mail folder access.

Mahogany is constantly being tested on a variety of Linux systems,
Solaris-sparc and MS Windows. It should compile and work on any modern
Unix platform.
