Announcing Mahogany Version 0.67
====================================================================

Mahogany is an OpenSource(TM) cross-platform mail news client. It is
available for X11/Unix and MS Windows platforms and supports many of
the Internet protocols and standards, including POP3, IMAP4
(and the secure versions using SSL), SMTP and NNTP. Mahogany also
supports MIME and many common Unix mailbox formats (including MBX,
MBOX and MH). Finally, Mahogany can be extended even further using
the built-in Python interpreter.

The main "selling points" of Mahogany in our opinion are:

* Cross-platform: use the same client to access your email from
  all the machines you use, share the settings between them.

* Everything is configurable: all aspects of the program behaviour
  may be changed by the user, yet you don't have to spend any time
  doing it before starting to use the program which is completely
  plug-and-play - but you can fit it to your needs later.

* High quality IMAP4 support: Mahogany is first and foremost an IMAP
  client and, although it does support POP3, it uses all the
  IMAP-only features (on demand message and attachment retrieval,
  server side messages copying/moving and also sorting/threading if
  available) and doesn't just consider IMAP as another kind of POP
  server.

* Open to the world: Mahogany integrates well with the other programs
  (be it your WWW browser or an editor) and doesn't lock the user in
  proprietary formats, but uses the standard ones whenever possible.

* Full featured: some of the features not yet mentioned are: modern
  GUI, built-in filters using a real programming language (but also
  GUI support for creating them without learning it), message
  templates, multiple identities, support for calendar plugin,
  powerful and flexible address book (with vCard support),
  synchronization with Palm, built-in HTML viewer, X-Face support,
  support for receiving faxes sent via EFax and much more.

Acknowledgements
=====================================================================

Mahogany is written using the OpenSource wxWidgets framework for GUI
C++ applications, building on the GTK+ toolkit on Unix and native
Win32 API under Windows. The imap-200x (c-client) library developed
by University of Washington is used for mail folder access. We also
use OpenSSL for SSL support and compface for X-Face support. We wish
to thank all the people whose work has made writing Mahogany much
simpler (and even possible at all)!

Changes Since Release 0.66
=====================================================================

Most important changes are:

* New integrated statistical spam filter (DSPAM)
* Better support for sharing preferences between multiple installations
* Unix port now uses GTK+ 2 toolkit
* Folders can now be dragged in the folder tree to reorder them
* Select the viewer best suited for the contents of the current message
* Highlight options with non default values in the preferences dialog
* New nop() (stop filter processing) filter action added
* The "Set From from To" option is now more useful
* Use clear text when replying to PGP-encrypted messages
* New ``Where is filter'' command
* Warning if you start replying to the same message a second time
* Detect forgotten attachments before sending the message
* Innumerable bug fixes 

Please see the CHANGES file in the distribution for more detailed list
of changes.


 Hoping you will enjoy Mahogany!
