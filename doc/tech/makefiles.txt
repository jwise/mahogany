How to add file
---------------
Linux makefiles take new files into account automatically. Visual C++
makefiles must be updated. Add following snippet to "appropriate" place
in M.DSP. Replace <folder> and <file> with your file.

# Begin Source File

SOURCE=.\src\<folder>\<file>.cpp
# End Source File
