--- TODO: edit this

 Just some quick news: I introduced a new abstraction in the message viewer
code called "view filters". Now MessageView doesn't put the stuff into the
viewer directly as it used to, but passes it to the registered filters
which can process the text (including changing it) and only then output it.
There is always at least one filter: TransparentFilter defined in
MessageView.cpp itself which simply passes the strings to the viewer
withotu changing them. It exists simply to avoid having to check for NULL
everywhere, we can be sure that in all the other filters the next pointer
is !NULL.

 I forgot to mention that the filters are organized in a linked list.
They're ordered by their priority (higher the priority -- sooner the filter
is applied) and the transparent filter is always the last one.

 The interesting thing is, of course, that you can have other filters as
well. For example, I intend to move the URL and quote level detection code
to a separate filter. Currently the only example of the filter is a
Rot13Filter (in src/modules). It isn't very interesting but it at least
shows that the filters work.

 Of course, the real plan is to have a PGP filter (with a very high
priority, so it will be applied first) which will decode the message text
on the fly and/or check (and remove) the signature. It should be also
possible to have UUdecode filter -- it will be probably easier to do it at
this level even if ideally it should have been done at c-client one.
