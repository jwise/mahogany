Script configure
----------------
Presumably you have already checked in new configure.in. Following commands
should be used to regenerate configure script. Replace $MAHOGANY_SOURCE and
$WX_SOURCE with your settings. You need at least wxWindows 2.5.

cd $MAHOGANY_SOURCE
mkdir ../configure
aclocal -I $WX_SOURCE --output=../configure/aclocal.m4
(cd ../configure; autoconf $MAHOGANY_SOURCE/configure.in >configure)
cp ../configure/configure ./configure
cvs commit -m "Regenerated" configure
