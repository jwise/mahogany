      <h2>Preamble</h2>

      <P>
	The intent of this document is to state the conditions under
	which this software package may be copied, such that the
	Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control
	over the development of the package, while giving the users of
	the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a
	more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
	reasonable modifications.
      <P>
	This license is based on <a
	href="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</a>'s ``Artistic License''
	and has been adapted to better suit <em>M</em>. It aims to
	confirm with the <a
	href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open-Source</a>
	specification.

      <HR>

      <h3>Definitions</h3>

      <blockquote>

	``Package'' refers to the collection of files distributed by
	the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of
	files created through textual modification.
	<P>
	  ``Standard Version'' refers to such a Package if it has not
	  been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the
	  wishes of the Copyright Holder as specified below.
	<P>
	  ``Copyright Holder'' is whoever is named in the copyright or
	  copyrights for the package.
	<P>
	  ``You'' is you, if you're thinking about copying or
	  distributing this Package.
	<P>
	  ``Reasonable copying fee'' is whatever you can justify on
	  the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people
	  involved, and so on.  (You will not be required to justify
	  it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing
	  community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)
	<P>
	  ``Freely Available'' means that no fee is charged for the
	  item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling
	  the item.  It also means that recipients of the item may
	  redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

	  <P><LI>You may make and give away verbatim copies of the
	  source form of the Standard Version of this Package without
	  restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original
	  copyright notices and associated disclaimers and only
	  distribute the complete package as a whole.

	  <P><LI>You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other
	  modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the
	  Copyright Holder.  A Package modified in such a way shall
	  still be considered the Standard Version.

	  <P><LI>You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in
	  any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each
	  changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and
	  provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
	  <P>
	  <OL TYPE="a">

	    <LI>place your modifications in the Public Domain or
	    otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting
	    said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or
	    placing the modifications on a major archive site such as
	    sunsite.unc.edu, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to
	    include your modifications in the Standard Version of the
	    Package, <em>and</em> rename any non-standard executables
	    so the names do not conflict with standard executables,
	    which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual
	    page for each non-standard executable that clearly
	    documents how it differs from the Standard Version. You
	    must <em>not</em> make the modified version depend on any
	    other software or libary if that software or libary is not
	    Freely Available or if it is covered under a license more
	    restrictive than this.

	    <LI>use the modified Package only within your corporation
	    or organization.

	    <LI>make other distribution arrangements with the
	    Copyright Holder.

	  <P><LI>You may distribute the programs of this Package in
	  object code or executable form, provided that you do at
	  least ONE of the following:
	  <P>
	  <OL TYPE="a">

	    <LI>distribute a Standard Version of the executables and
	    library files, together with instructions (in the manual
	    page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.

	    <LI>accompany the distribution with the machine-readable
	    source of the Package with your modifications, including
	    the complete machine-readable source of the unmodified
	    Standard Version. You must <em>not</em> make the modified
	    version depend on any other software or libary if that
	    software or libary is not Freely Available or if it is
	    covered under a license more restrictive than this. 

	    <LI>give non-standard executables non-standard names, and
	    clearly document the differences in manual pages (or
	    equivalent), together with instructions on where to get
	    the Standard Version.

	    <LI>make other distribution arrangements with the
	    Copyright Holder.

	  </OL>
	  
	  <P><LI>You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any
	  distribution of this Package.  You may charge any fee you
	  choose for support of this Package.  You may not charge a
	  fee for this Package itself.  However, you may distribute
	  this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial)
	  programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
	  distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package
	  as a product of your own.

	  <P><LI>The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to
	  endorse or promote products derived from this software
	  without specific prior written permission. However, all
