Pressing the hash key '#' or 'x' in the list of messages expunges all deleted ones.
If you set your user level to "advanced" in the identity tab in the preferences, you can set *all* options on a per-folder level.
You can tell Mahogany to include a little picture of you with every message sent, by setting up an "XFace" in the preferences.
Mahogany allows you to use SSL encryption for secure access to all servers. But you will have to re-compile it yourself (for legal reasons). 
If you need help or support with using Mahogany, you can joing the Mahogany users' forum by sending a message to m-users-subscribe@egroups.com . Of course, you can also subscribe to that forum via our web pages at http://www.wxwindows.org/Mahogany/.
When reading news, you can mark messages as read by pressing 'D'. Deleted news articles will not be shown to you again.
As Mahogany is an OpenSource project, you can add your own favorite feature to it. We are always happy to welcome new developers to help us improve it. Just get in touch with us by sending an email to m-developers@egroups.com .
If you find a bug in Mahogany or have a suggestion for an improvement, the best thing to do is to go to http://www.wxwindows.org/m-bugs/ and report it to our bug-tracking system. You will then be notified once we have dealt with it.\nThis is much better than just sending us an e-mail, as the bug-tracker makes sure that we will not forget it.
When you write messages, you can save copies of the messages to a mailbox by listing the mailbox name in the CC or BCC fields, prefixed with a hash '#' symbol. I.e. If you put "#MyMailBox" in the CC field, it will save a copy of the message to the mailbox "MyMailBox". If this does not exist, it will create a mailbox of that name in your default mailbox directory. You can also use a filename here, e.g. "#/tmp/savedMail".
Remember that remote IMAP mailboxes are not read-only! You can store messages there, too. So if you access your mail from different systems and want to use filtering rules, you can store all messages on the IMAP server instead of local mailbox files and they will be accessible from everywhere.
As Mahogany integrates e-Mail and Usenet News, you can use filtering rules to let Mahogany watch newsgroups for you and forward all interesting articles to your main mailbox. So you don't need to read a newsgroup yourself if you are only interested in articles about a certain topic.
If you use a PalmOS handheld computer with Mahogany, you can combine this with filtering rules to create very useful automatism. For example, you could set up a filtering rule on a local newsgroup carrying social information like e.g. cinema programs and automatically copy the messages that you are interested in to the PalmBox mailbox. The next time that you hotsync from within Mahogany, these will be transferred to your Palm Pilot.
As Mahogany is an OpenSource project developed by volunteers, we are always very happy to welcome help from anyone. If you would like to add your favourite feature to it or want to change something about it - get in touch with us! Mahogany can be exactly the way you like it, because you can help us be that way. Just get in touch with us via m-developers@egroups.com .
If you use Mahogany in a non-English environment and it is not yet translated to your language, or the translations are incomplete, get in touch with us and we can update the translations. As we don't do them ourselves, we have to rely on others to tell us about this and actually translate it for us.
