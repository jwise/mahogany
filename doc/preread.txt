                                        WARNING

 This is an alpha version of the Mahogany e-mail client. "Alpha" means that
many of the features which the finished product will have are still lacking
and that you may (and probably will) find bugs in it. We release this
version only as a demonstration of how Mahogany will look like in the
future and do NOT recommend using it as your main e-mail client (although
it is possible and the authors do use it).

 We release this version hoping that it will attract interest to Mahogany
and that, may be, you can even already find it useful. Of course, we would
also like to get your feedback, so don't hesitate to contact us at
m-users@egroups.com with any questions, ideas or bug reports.

 Enjoy!

M-Team
