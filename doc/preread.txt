WARNING: This is an alpha version of the Mahogany e-mail
         client. "Alpha" means that many of the features
	 which the finished product will have are still
	 lacking and that you may (and probably will) find
	 bugs in it. We release this version only as a
	 demonstration of how Mahogany will look like in the
	 future and do NOT recommend using it as your main
	 e-mail client (although it is possible and the
	 authors do use it).
