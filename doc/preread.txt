                                        *** WARNING ***

 This is the 0.62 alpha version of the Mahogany e-mail client. "Alpha" means
that many of the features which the finished product will have are still
lacking and that you may (and probably will) find bugs in it. We release this
version only as a demonstration of how Mahogany will look like in the future
and do NOT recommend using it as your main e-mail client just yet (although it
is possible and one of the authors does use it), however we do recommend that
you try it out and tell us what do you think.

 Please send your impressions, questions, feature requests and bug reports to
                             mahogany-users@lists.sourceforge.net
and help us to improve this program.

 Thanks for trying Mahogany!
