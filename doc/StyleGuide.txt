C++ Coding Style Guide

Karsten Ballüder (Ballueder@usa.net, http://Ballueder.home.ml.org)

Abstract

This document is a set of notes explaining my preferred style of coding
for C++, as it should be used throughout M in order to avoid unnecessary
reformatting between different developers. The following guidelines
have proven themselves to be useful during several cross-platform
projects.

1 Preprocessor Usage

1.1 #define's

1.1.1 features and compile time defines

As most platforms use the GNU configure system to set defines, we have
to follow its way of doing things. Therefor all defines which enable
or disable features, should follow the following conventions:

1. If they define a compile time option, they should be called USE_XXX,
  if they define the availability of something, they should be called
  HAVE_XXX.

2. If defined, they must have the value 1. Never define it to be 0,
  but use #undef instead.

1.1.2 Operating system identifiers

The source code must never reference any prdefined symbols such as
__unix__ or __WINDOWS__. Instead, the global source configuration
header file should check for them and define appropriate OS_XX values.
Examples are: OS_WIN, OS_UNIX, OS_LINUX, OS_SOLARIS. Obviously, more
than one of them can be defined at the same time, e.g. OS_UNIX and
OS_SOLARIS. Also, OS_POSIX may be helpful. All of thes are either
defined to 1 or undefined.

1.1.3 Compiler identifiers

For identifying different compilers rules analog to operating systems
hold. I.e. there should be defines of the type CC_XXX defined. So
far, M supports the following two compilers:

* GNU gcc: CC_GCC, including egcs.

* Microsoft Visual C++: CC_MSC

1.2 #include's

1.2.1 precompiled headers

To support precompiled headers and to avoid unnecessarily compiling
headers multiple times, one global header file Mpch.h exists and should
be used in the following way:

* On systems that support precompiled headers: it includes Mconfig.h
  and all other header files which are used reasonably often.

* On systems without precompiled headers, it only includes Mconfig.h.

All source files should include Mpch.h, all header files should include
Mconfig.h.

1.3 Indentation

* All preprocessor directives must start at column 0. Indentation should
  happen between the leading hash (#) and the directive.

* Indentation is by a TAB characters, or by eight spaces.

* Between a #include and the file name, there should be a TAB, not
  a space.

Example:







2 Naming conventions

2.1 General

* Do not use names starting with underscores, like _malloc or __malloc.

* Class names always start with capital letters, variable names start
  with lower case letters, i.e. MApplication is a class name, mApplication
  is a variable name.

* Do not use hungarian notation.

* When using names consisting of several words, use mixed capitalisation,
  not underscores, i.e. use MyNewClass, not My_new_class.

* Avoid duplicating names of classes as variable names, i.e. MApplication
  and mApplication, unless when there is only one instance of that
  class, then it should be the same name, e.g. MyApp myApp;.

* Use const wherever possible, both for parameters and for methods.

* Try to avoid templates.

3 Formatting of C/C++ code

3.1 Rule of thumb

Format your code like seen in Bjarne Stroustrup's The C++ Programming
Language.

3.2 braces

Always put braces on a line by themselves. 

Do not write code like:

 



but write







3.3 Use DOC++ comments

It's pretty buggy, but maybe some day there will be a working version
of it, so use it.

4 Other coding issues

4.1 Local data

Do not define arrays as local variables, but explicitly allocate and
deallocate them using new [] and delete []. If defined as local variables,
they will get allocated on the stack which might overflow and produce
wrong results without any warnings, which is difficult to detect.

4.2 Use prefixes in global names

When defining macros or global variable names (In some cases, this
should also apply to class names.), use a library or application specific
prefix to avoid conflicts with symbols defined in other libraries. 

Example:

Do not define a global macro such as SIZE(x), but call it mylibSIZE(x)
or mSIZE(x).

4.3 Indentation

4.3.1 Tabulators and Spaces

To make cooperation easier we have agreed to not to use any tabulator
characters in the sources. Instead three spaces should be used. The
basic indentation depth is three spaces per level.

4.3.2 Braces

Braces should always be on a line by themselves. If following a control
statement, they should be on the same indentation level as that statement.
E.g. the brace after an if() statement should be directly under the
``i''
