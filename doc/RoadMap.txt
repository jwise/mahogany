--------------- Roadmap for M releases ----------------------------------

Here is the rough plan for the future of the M development:


* 0.65-0.70:

   + ADB lift up:

      - it becomes very slow with big books and the autocollect book grows
        really fast (~1000 entries in mine) and the books are also way too
        big. We need a more efficient and more compact format. Support for
        Gnome and KDE address books (maybe even Windows WAB? ;).

      - GUI side: we need a reusable ADB-tree control like the folder tree
        one which could be reused from other places (composer, extract
        addresses dialog, ...) and it should also support multiple selection

   + implement text only message editor

   + built-in anti SPAM rule (?)

* 0.75:

   + real MIME types editor

   + implement smart config file synchronization

   + store ADB on IMAP server and sync it

   + composer improvements:
     - spell checker
     - smart line wrap.

* 0.80:

   + virtual folder support, search should optionally put the results in
     the "Search results" vFolder

* 1.00:

   + fully MT - this is the hard part

   + PGP/GPG support

* 2.00 should have decent news reading support:

   + handling multipart messages

   + different convenience features such as ROT-13, spoiler space, ...
