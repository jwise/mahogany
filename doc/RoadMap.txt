--------------- Roadmap for M releases ----------------------------------

Here is the rough plan for the future of the M development:

* 0.65:

   get it out of the door a.s.a.p., the last release was 9 months ago
   we just need to fix the crash on exit with IMAP bug

   tentative release date: before the end of the year

* 0.66:

   + add "IMAP migration" and "Export to MBOX" commands: both will be
     implemented using the new MTool module class and will be accessible
     from the main executable "Tools" menu

   + add "Server" entiry: i.e. each remote folder has an associated server
     and the servers can be configured in their own dialog. This should include
     IMAP, POP, NNTP but also SMTP

   + ongoing SPAM filtering improvements

* 0.67:

   + ADB lift up:

      - it becomes very slow with big books and the autocollect book grows
        really fast (~1000 entries in mine) and the books are also way too
        big. We need a more efficient and more compact format. Support for
        Gnome and KDE address books (it would be nice to have Windows WAB
        support as well but I didn't find any docs about it)?

      - GUI side: we need a reusable ADB-tree control like the folder tree
        one which could be reused from other places (composer, extract
        addresses dialog, ...) and it should also support multiple selections

* 0.70:

   + implement smart config file synchronization

   + store ADB on IMAP server and sync it

   + composer framework improvements:
     - implement text only message editor
     - spell checker
     - smart line wrap.

   + real MIME types editor

* 0.80:

   + we really need a decent rich text editor...

* 1.00:

   + fully MT - this is the hard part

   + PGP/GPG support

* 2.00 should have decent news reading support:

   + handling multipart (in news, not MIME, sense) messages

   + different convenience features such as ROT-13, spoiler space, ...
