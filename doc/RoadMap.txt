--------------- Roadmap for M releases ----------------------------------

Here is the rough plan for the future of the M development:


* 0.65-0.70: 2 main tasks are

   + compose classes split similar to the message view one, i.e. separate
     the GUI-independent logic from the GUI stuff and make it modularizable
     to allow for having multiple compose implementations (e.g. a simple
     wxTextCtrl instead of wxLayout-based composer)

     There should be also provision for spell checker in the new interface!

     And smart line wrap.

   + ADB lift up:
   
      - it becomes very slow with big books and the autocollect book grows
        really fast (~1000 entries in mine) and the books are also way too
        big. We need a more efficient and more compact format.

      - GUI side: we need a reusable ADB-tree control like the folder tree
        one which could be reused from other places (composer, extract
        addresses dialog, ...) and it should also support multiple selection


   Also it would be very nice to:

   + implement Drafts folder and save messages in it in case of a crash
     or interrupt


* 0.75:

   + real MIME types editor

   + allow using the config file under Windows as well, sync with it
     at startup/shutdown
     
   + store ADB on IMAP server and sync it

* 1.00:

   + fully MT - this is the hard part

   + PGP/GPG support

* 2.00 should have decent news reading support:

   + handling multipart messages

   + different convenience features such as ROT-13, spoiler space, ...
