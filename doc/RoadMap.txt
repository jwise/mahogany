--------------- Roadmap for M releases ----------------------------------

Here is the rough plan for the future of the M development:

* 0.67:

   + implement smart config file synchronization: Mahogany main advantage
     is its cross-platform nature however it's not very useful if you can't
     keep the same (but not exactly the same!) options on all machines you use,
     we must do something about it.

* 0.68:

   + ADB lift up:

      - it becomes very slow with big books and the autocollect book grows
        really fast (~1000 entries in mine) and the books are also way too
        big. We need a more efficient and more compact format. Support for
        Gnome and KDE address books (it would be nice to have Windows WAB
        support as well but I didn't find any docs about it)?

      - GUI side: we need a reusable ADB-tree control like the folder tree
        one which could be reused from other places (composer, extract
        addresses dialog, ...) and it should also support multiple selections

   + store ADB on IMAP server and sync it

* 0.69:

   + spell checker

* 0.70:

   + support for encrypting/signing messages with PGP

   + add "Server" entiry: i.e. each remote folder has an associated server
     and the servers can be configured in their own dialog. This should include
     IMAP, POP, NNTP but also SMTP

   + real MIME types editor

* 0.80:

   + we really need a decent rich text editor...

* 1.00:

   + fully MT - this is the hard part

* 2.00 should have decent news reading support:

   + .newsrc-based storage (current config structure is unsuitable for news)

   + handling multipart (in news, not MIME, sense) messages

   + different convenience features such as ROT-13, spoiler space, ...
