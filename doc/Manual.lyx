Using Mahogany 
\layout Section

Release Notes_1001_
\layout Standard

This is the fourth public release of Mahogany.
 As with the previous release we make the source available and binaries
 for Linux-x86, Linux-alpha and Solaris-sparc.
 The main change since the previous release is that we now provide a Win32
 (requires Windows 95/98/NT) version of Mahogany.
\layout Standard

Mahogany is also reported to compile and run on FreeBSD and should generally
 work on any Unix flavour.
 We didn't try it on Win32s platform and we're not going to support it (nor
 Win16).
 Finally, work on making Mahogany available for MacOS is in progress.
\layout Standard

Due to the fact that it is a cross-platform effort, the compilation and
 make system are a bit more complex than the average package.
 However, the source code is provided and you can attempt to compile it
 yourself.
 If you are trying to port it to a new platform, let us know and we will
 be happy to help you.
\layout Subsection

Changes against the previous version
\layout Subsubsection

0.23a against 0.22a
\layout Standard

The main news is, of course, the long-waited for availability of Win32 version.
 Also:
\layout Itemize

Several bugs in message composer (including a few fatal ones) were fixed.
 Only minor problems still persist.
\layout Itemize

Selections support (copy, cut, paste) in message composer and viewer.
\layout Itemize

The 
\family typewriter 
[Apply]
\family default 
and
\family typewriter 
[Cancel]
\family default 
buttons in the options and folder properties dialogs (mostly) work now.
\layout Itemize

Several minor bug fixes and improvements, including a massive speedup in
 the update of folder listings over slow connections.
\layout Itemize

Printing no longer has overlap between pages.
\layout Itemize

Folders can be kept open all the time to speed up access to them, very useful
 for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

SentMail
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 folder.
\layout Itemize

Better behaved, asks before removing all mail from spool.
\layout Itemize

Message boxes now have icons in them.
\layout Itemize

And, of course, updated translations and documentation updates.
\layout Standard

We have also made good progress on the filtering code, PGP/GPG support,
 multi-threading support and support for loadable external modules, but
 these features are not complete yet and disabled in the release.
 Expect them to appear in the next releases.
\layout Subsubsection

0.22a against 0.21a
\layout Standard

Release 0.22a is mainly a bugfix release against 0.21a.
\layout Itemize

All know (crash-inducing) bugs fixed.
 
\layout Itemize

Message editor/viewer improvements, adding clipboard support and selections.
 
\layout Itemize

wxGTK layout bug fixes - German, French, Spanish translations 
\layout Itemize

Text-search in messages 
\layout Itemize

Several minor usability fixes, sub-folder support fixed.
 
\layout Itemize

Addressbook fixes 
\layout Itemize

TCP timeouts configurable 
\layout Itemize

Support for setting the Reply-To: header from To: field in message replies.
\layout Subsubsection

0.10a to 0.21a
\layout Standard

First, there are some user-visible changes against the latest version, most
 notably the much improved message editor.
 This is still work in progress and the next release should add the sorely
 missed cut and paste support which only recently became functional in the
 underlying wxGTK toolkit.
 Also, configurability has been much extended.
 For the first time, Mahogany now defaults to collecting all mail from the
 system's INBOX (whatever that is) to a central 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

New Mail
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 folder.
 It can easily be set up to watch any number of different mail accounts
 or newsgroups and collect mail from them.
\layout Standard

This release got a bit delayed because we decided to finish some long planned
 changes under the hood, mainly a complete rewrite of the internal configuration
 system which now provides the inheriting configuration settings we had
 planned, something that will become obvious in the next release when full
 GUI support for it will be added.
 Also, we seriously improved the mailfolder handling code to reliably handle
 all kinds of error conditions, such as modified or disappearing mailboxes
 or terminated connections and recover from them safely.
 Also, Mahogany now has full working support for IMAP, NNTP and newsspools.
\layout Standard

Apart from this there were many minor fixes and changes, both GUI and mail
 code, documented in detail at the end of the TODO file.
\layout Subsection

Which features are implemented?
\layout Standard

Quite some already, but more are still missing.
 What we have so far:
\layout Itemize

Cross-platform.
 Mahogany compiles on a variety of Unix systems and on Microsoft Windows.
 Use one mail client, no matter what system you use.
 The source and binary for Windows 95/98/NT are available on request (
\latex latex 

\backslash 
htmladdnormallinkfoot{
\family typewriter 
m-developers@makelist.com
\family default 
}{
\family typewriter 
m-developers@makelist.com
\family default 
}
\latex default 
).
 Mailbox file formats are the same on both platforms.
\layout Itemize

Based on the c-client library from the University of Washington, therefore
 full access to a wide range of protocols and file formats, including SMTP,
 IMAP, POP3, NNTP and several mailbox formats.
\layout Itemize

Wide user configurability.
 Whatever makes sense to override or change, can be changed by the user.
 Configuration supports several configuration files on Unix, with special
 administrator support for making entries immutable, and the registry on
 Windows.
\layout Itemize

Scriptable and extendable.
 Mahogany includes an embedded Python interpreter with full access to its
 object hierarchy.
 Write object-oriented scripts to extend and control Mahogany.
\layout Itemize

Easy MIME support.
 Text and other content can be freely mixed and different filetypes are
 represented by icons.
\layout Itemize

Inline displaying of images, clickable URLs, XFace support.
\layout Itemize

Multiple mail folders, support for any number of diffferent mail or news
 servers.
\layout Itemize

Powerful address database and contact manager 
\layout Itemize

Context sensitive help system (HTML based).
\layout Itemize

Full internationalisation support, Mahogany speaks multiple languages.
\layout Subsection

Known bugs
\layout Itemize

The message editor still has some minor glitches but appears stable and
 reliable now.
\layout Itemize

Newsspool support will not work with newsgroups not listed in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

active
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 file and is little configurable.
\layout Subsection

TODO, features to implement
\layout Standard

This is a list of features on our TODO list that we are currently working
 on.
 It is not necessarily up to date or complete.
\layout Subsubsection

We are currently working on the implementation of the following:
\layout Itemize

Easy to use and powerful filtering system for mails (about one third complete).
\layout Itemize

Finishing rewrite of message editor: rich text editing & HTML
\layout Itemize

Threading and scoring of messages and news articles.
\layout Itemize

Multi-threaded folder access, to avoid blocking while retrieving slow remote
 folders/servers.
\layout Itemize

Subscription management for news and IMAP servers.
\layout Itemize

Templates for message composition and replies.
\layout Itemize

Support for PGP and GNU Privacy Guard to encrypt mails.
 
\layout Itemize

Full Drag and Drop interaction with filemanagers of Windows and Gnome/KDE,
 recently added to wxWindows.
\layout Itemize

Wide character (Unicode) support and other character sets, currently being
 added to wxWindows.
\layout Itemize

Searching in folders.
\layout Itemize

A calendar add-on to to add some some time planning, reminder functionality
 (early planning stage).
\layout Subsubsection

Further we plan the following:
\layout Itemize

Better Python support.
 We have some callbacks in place, but after the class hierarchy rewrite
 we have to generate new interface files for the complete class hierarchy.
 Also by this time wxPython might be integrated, so we can actually write
 some of the configuration dialogs in python which should speed things up.
 
\shape italic 
Help welcome.
\layout Itemize

Support for V-cards.
\layout Itemize

Spam-Ex spam fighting/auto-complaint function.
\layout Itemize

Compression of mail folders.
\layout Itemize

Delay-Folder to keep mails and re-present them at a later date.
\layout Itemize

More import, export and synchronisation with other programs' address databases.
\layout Itemize

Voice mail.
\layout Itemize

CORBA support for GNOME and KDE.
\layout Itemize

ANY OTHER SUGGESTION
\layout Subsection

Help Needed
\layout Standard

As you can see, we have big plans for Mahogany.
 To achieve all this, we need some help.
 Areas where we would use some help are
\layout Itemize

Python 
\layout Itemize

support for further mail protocols, LDAP
\layout Itemize

The wxQt project, a port of wxWindows to the Qt toolkit, can also use any
 help.
 We are not directly involved in this, but being involved with wxWindows,
 we are happy to support that port.
\layout Itemize

If you have access to other systems apart from Linux/Solaris/FreeBSD/Windows,
 you are very welcome to help us port Mahogany to those platforms, or to
 other hardware than Intel.
\layout Itemize

Translations to other languages (We have support for German, French, Spanish
 at present.
 Czech and Brasilian-Portuguese are underway.).
\layout Itemize

MacOS development
\layout Itemize


\series bold 
Generally we welcome help for anything.
 If you miss a feature in Mahogany, we are more than happy to help you implement
 it yourself.
 Naturally we tend to work on the features that we either need ourselves
 or find interesting to do.
 If your priorities are different, join our team and help us improve it.
 Mahogany is and will always be an OpenSource(TM) project and your involvement
 is wanted! If you have any questions about this, please contact the developers

\layout Subsubsection

Why not the GPL/BSD/QPL/my favourite license?
\layout Standard

Recently discussions about which license to chose for which project provoced
 major flamewars in the unix community.
 There is a trend to put everything under the GPL or LGPL.
 We do not want to get involved in this highly emotional and political discussio
n.
 Our intent is to alllow everyone to use and modify Mahogany while preserving
 some form of control over its development.
 That is why we chose a modified version of Perl's Artistic License.
 It is both more and less restrictive than the GPL in certain ways.
 We do not believe that there is one right license for everything.
 The Mahogany Artistic License is much simpler and easier to understand
 than the GPL, so we feel more comfortable with it.
 If you want to do something with Mahogany and feel that the license poses
 a problem, 
\series bold 
please
\series default 
 contact us! We do not want the license to be a problem and any reasonable
 request for deviating uses of Mahogany will be likely to be granted.
 If in doubt, ask us and we will find a solution.

\layout Section

Introduction / Tutorial
\layout Standard

To get started on Mahogany, you should look at the following sections of
 this manual:
\layout Itemize

The Folder Tree (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{FolderTreeCtrl}

\end_inset 

) and how to create new folders (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{CreateNewFolderDialog}

\end_inset 

).
\layout Itemize

The explanation of the INBOX (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{INBOX Folder}

\end_inset 

) and New Mail (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{New Mail Folder}

\end_inset 

) folders.
\layout Standard

Obviously, the more of this manual you read, the better use you can make
 of Mahogany.
 Once the manual has grown too large, we will provide a short tutorial,
 but for now we go on coding instead.
\layout Subsection

Getting started
\layout Standard

When you start Mahogany for the first time, it will present you with a rather
 lengthy configuration dialog where you can configure all kinds of more
 or less useful options.
 Don't be afraid of it - just make sure that the main points, notably the
 settings on the Identity (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{IdentityPage}

\end_inset 

) and Network () page are correct and ignore the rest for now.
 The defaults should be suitable for most situations.
\layout Standard

The main window will then show you a tree of folders (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{FolderTreeCtrl}

\end_inset 

) on the left and a view of the currently selected folder (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{FolderView}

\end_inset 

) to the right of it.
 By default, you will find a small number of folders that Mahogany sets
 up for you, usually these are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

INBOX
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

SentMail
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

New Mail
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 So, what are they? 
\layout Itemize


\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

SentMail
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is obvious, Mahogany will store copies of messages that you send in there.
 
\layout Itemize


\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

INBOX
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is a little more tricky, it represents the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

system inbox
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 for your system.
 This depends on your system setup, on Unix, it will most commonly be the
 
\family typewriter 
/var/spool/mail
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 
/var/mail
\family default 
 entry for you, or wherever new mail for you gets stored.
 If you have an existing 
\family typewriter 
mbox
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 
INBOX
\family default 
 mailfolder in your home directory, as created by some other mail software,
 it will refer to this.
 Generally, you don't need to worry about it, it will just be a black-box
 showing you new mail on the system you are logged in to.
 If it should not work, you can just create a folder entry for wherever
 the mail gets stored and ignore 
\family typewriter 
INBOX
\family default 
.
\layout Itemize


\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

New Mail
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is just a normal file folder, which is used by Mahogany to store mail that
 it collects from other places.
 By default, Mahogany will attempt to collect all new mail arriving in 
\family typewriter 
INBOX
\family default 
 and move it to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

New Mail
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, as it is considered bad practice to leave messages in the system spool
 area.
 Also, if you want to collect mail from more than one location, for example
 from your ISP's POP account, Mahogany will move it to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

New Mail
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 It's just a convenient central place to store new messages, so you have
 them all in one folder, no matter where they come from.
 Of course, you can change this, if you don't like it.
 Whether Mahogany collects mail from a folder or not, can be set in the
 Properties dialog of the folder, accessible via a click with the right
 mouse button in the folder tree.
 If you try this, you will see, that Mahogany is set up to collect from
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

INBOX
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, but not from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

SentMail
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 Good.
\layout Subsection

So how about setting up POP access? And what is IMAP?
\layout Standard

Setting up POP access is dead easy: You simply click the right mouse button
 in the folder tree and select 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Create new folder
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 Then fill in the details: your username and password for accessing the
 account and the hostname of the POP server.
 If you want Mahogany to collect all mail from here and move it to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

New Mail
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 automatically, tick the box, otherwise it will leave the messages on the
 server and you can only read them while you are online.
\layout Subsubsection

IMAP - what's that?
\layout Standard

IMAP is POP's big brother.
 Faster, more powerful and better, even more secure.
 If your ISP supports it, use IMAP rather than POP, your phone bills will
 go down, too.
 It's really just a different protocol for accessing the folder, but can
 do a few fancy things, more about that later.
\layout Subsection

How to set up your mail accounts
\layout Standard

** This is currently missing, see the text in the FAQ.
 I will explain here how to set up your accounts.
\layout Section

Setting up Mahogany, its configuration files
\layout Subsection

User configuration files
\layout Standard

When run for the first time, Mahogany creates a directory called 
\family typewriter 
.M
\family default 
 in the user's home directory.
 The file 
\family typewriter 
$HOME/.M/config
\family default 
 will contain the current program configuration for this user.
 Only values different from the default configuration are stored here.
 If you want to obtain a list of all possible options, you can manually
 add the entry
\layout Quote


\family typewriter 
RecordDefaults = 1
\layout Standard

to the 
\family typewriter 
[M/Profiles]
\family default 
 section of the configuration file.
 This will cause all values which are used to be written to the configuration
 file.
\layout Subsection

System wide configuration file
\layout Standard

Mahogany can be pre-configured on a system wide basis by supplying a 
\family typewriter 
M.conf
\family default 
 file in the Mahogany installation directory (e.g.
 
\family typewriter 
/usr/share/Mahogany/M.conf
\family default 
).
 The syntax for this configuration file is identical to the user's configuration
 file, so you can just copy a user's file to this location and edit it by
 hand.
 Useful settings for a system wide default are servers or mail return addresses.
 Note though, that Mahogany will not run properly as 
\family typewriter 
root
\family default 
.
 Entries prefixed with an exclamation mark 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 are marked as immutable and cannot be overwritten by the user.
 This can be used by the system administrator to hard-wire certain settings,
 like, for example the return mail addresses or mail servers to use.
\layout Section

The User Interface
\layout Subsection

The Main Window_2001_
\layout Standard

Mahogany's main window is vertically divided into two parts.
 On the left it has a tree view (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{FolderTreeCtrl}

\end_inset 

)of all available mail or news folders.
 On the right of it, it shows the currently selected folder in a folder
 view(see 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{FolderView}

\end_inset 

).
\layout Subsection

The Folder Tree_2004_
\layout Standard


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{FolderTreeCtrl}

\end_inset 

The folder tree shows a hierarchical view of all folders managed by Mahogany,
 this includes both mail folders and newsgroups.
 Folders can be grouped hierarchical and inherit settings from their parent
 folders (e.g.
 the server host).
 Clicking the right mouse button on any tree node will pop up a menu with
 some options.
 To open a folder or connection to a server for the first time, choose 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Create New Folder
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 which will show you a dialog (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{CreateNewFolderDialog}

\end_inset 

).
\layout Subsection

Create New Folder Dialog
\layout Standard


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{CreateNewFolderDialog}

\end_inset 

This menu entry allows you to open a connection to a server or view a mailfolder.
 No matter whether it is a POP, IMAP, NNTP connection , a file based mailfolder,
 a newsgroup or whatever, Mahogany treats them all the same and calls them
 all 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

folder
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 The dialog has (when the user level is set to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Password
\series default 

\newline 
For those folder types where it is required, you can specify the password
 here.
 If you leave it empty, Mahogany will prompt you for the password whenever
 it is needed.
 If you want to auto-collect mail from this folder, you should really specify
 it.
 
\series bold 
This is a potential security risk!
\series default 
 The password typed in here will get stored in your $HOME/.M/config configuration
 file on Unix or in the registry on Windows.
 While this file will be created as only readable by you and the passwords
 be encrypted (using very weak encryption), it is nevertheless a certain
 risk.
 If you accidentially change the permissions of that file, someone else
 could obtain your passwords, though Mahogany would detect this the next
 time it starts and warn you about it.
 Generally this should not pose a problem, but you should be aware of this.
 Previous versions of Mahogany had the passwords world-readable, so if you
 used it before this release, you might want to change them.

Folder Views_2002_
\layout Standard


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{FolderView}

\end_inset 

A Folder View is a window or part of a window displaying the contents of
 a mail folder or a newsgroup.
 It consists of two parts:
\layout Itemize

The list of message headers at the top, showing message subjects, authors,
 dates, etc.
\layout Itemize

The contents of the currently selected message below.
\layout Standard

The reaction to a mouse click in the list of messages depends on the preferences
 setting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Preview message when selected
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

.
 When the option is selected, a single mouse click will select the message
 and load it into the preview window.
 If the option is not set, the message will only be selected but not previewed
 automatically, which is very useful for accessing mail folders through
 a slow connection.
 The same setting effects the behavious of the space bar, it acts excatly
 like a single mouse click in the window and will only cause a message to
 be previewed if a single mouse click is configured to do so.
 The key 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

V
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 can be used to view the message under the current cursor.
 Also, using the mouse or the space bar together with the SHIFT or CTRL
 keys, allows one to select multiple messages at once.
\layout Standard

When the top window, the list of messages, is active, certain keyboard bindings
 are active, the following keys are recognized:

Reading Mail
\layout Subsection

The INBOX Folder
\layout Standard


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{INBOX Folder}

\end_inset 

The folder named INBOX has a special meaning.
 It is the main system mailbox and cannot be deleted or renamed.
 All new mail will arrive in here.
 At present, Mahogany leaves all messages in the system inbox.
 Mahogany will collect mail from several different incoming mailboxes, e.g.
 the INBOX and some additional POP3 accounts, and move them to a new folder.
 
\layout Subsection

The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

New Mail
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 Folder
\layout Standard


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{New Mail Folder}

\end_inset 

Created by Mahogany the first time you start it, this is a file mailbox
 which by default receives all new mail.
 If you mark any folder as incoming, its contents will be checked regularly
 and any new mail in it moved to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

New Mail
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 folder.
 If you do not like this name, you can change it in the preferences dialog.
 Mahogany should in all situations recover from closed connections or disappeari
ng mailboxes, so it is safe to let it run over long periods of time.
 If a server connection times out, you will receive one or possibly a few
 error messages but Mahogany will reopen the connection and continue as
 usual.
\layout Subsection

Other Folders
\layout Standard

The folders are organized in a tree structure: this is purely for the convenienc
e of the user, so any folder may contain as many other folders as needed.
 Folders can be managed either from the top level menu or from the popup
 menu in the folder control invoked by pressing the right mouse button in
 it.
 You can group folders together by making the sub folders of another folder.
 This builds no physical connection between the folders but makes the sub
 folder inherit certain configuration defaults settings from their parent
 folder.
 We will soon add a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

folder group
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 folder type not representing any mailbox but just being a group of folders.
\layout Subsection

Accessing Mail Remotely
\layout Standard

Mahogany supports two protocols for accessing remote mail servers: POP3
 and IMAP.
 While POP3 is more commonly available, IMAP is definitely the superiour
 protocol and should be used where available.
 It will generally give you more functionality and will be much faster over
 slow connections.
 Both normally require you to log in with a username and password, but can
 be configured to work anonymously if supported by the server.
 IMAP additionally allows you to access any mailfolder file on the remote
 machine.
 For example, if you use Mahogany on a remote machine 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
atwork.company.com
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, you might have your local 
\family typewriter 
INBOX
\family default 
 (which could be 
\family typewriter 
/var/spool/mail/MyUserName
\family default 
 on a unix box) and also your 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

New Mail
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 folder, which might be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
/home/MyUserName/.M/New Mail
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 With IMAP, if you log in from home, you can not only access your INBOX
 on the atwork.company.com mail server, but also the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
New Mail
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 folder there, by telling Mahogany to use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
/home/MyUserName/.M/New Mail
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 as the path to the mailbox file.
 Like this, you can access any mail folder on that machine that you have
 access to locally, making remote access to your mail much more flexible
 than just accessing your new messages.
\layout Section

Sending Mail
\layout Subsection

To: CC: and BCC: Settings
\layout Standard

All of these fields accept either mail addresses, aliases or folder names.
 Aliases must be expanded by using the tabulator key or the Expand button
 next to the fields.
 If multiple entries match the text, you will be prompted with a list to
 choose from.
 
\layout Subsubsection

Using Folder names as an address
\layout Standard

Folder names can be entered by prefixing them with a hash ('#') sign.
 This will cause a copy of the message to be saved in the folder with this
 name.
 If no such folder exists, it will be created in the mail folder directory.
 For example, entering 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

joe.user@foo.com, #myMail
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in the To: field, will send the mail to Joe User and save a copy of it
 in the folder 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

myMail
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 Note, that if you have your folders organised hieararchically, you must
 specify the full path to the folder in the folder tree control.
 An example: If you have a group of folders in the tree, called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Work
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and want to save a copy of the message to the folder 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

TODO
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 which is a sub-folder of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Work
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, you need to add 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

#Work/TODO
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in the address field.
 Instead of using the To: field for this, you can also use CC: or BCC:,
 there is no difference.
\layout Subsubsection

To:
\layout Standard

The primary address to which to send the message, multiple addresses can
 be entered and must be comma-separated.
\layout Subsubsection

CC:
\layout Standard

CC means Carbon Copy - copies of the message will get sent to the addresses
 listed here.
 
\layout Subsubsection

BCC:
\layout Standard

BCC means Blind Carbon Copy - like CC:, copies will be sent to the addresses
 listed here, but the addresses will not be stored in the mail header.
 This allows you to send copies without other recipients of the message
 knowing about it.

Using the address book_3100_
\layout Standard

Although you may directly enter the addresses of recepients of your message
 into the different address fields (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

To:
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Cc:
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Bcc:
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

 althought the last two are optional and so might not appear), there is
 a more convenient way to do it using the address book.
 To insert an address fromyour adress book you should type the first few
 letters of either the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

nick name
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 (or the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

alias
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

) for this address or the the first letters of the e-mail address and press
 <TAB> key or click on the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Expand
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 button.
 If there is only one possible expansion for the letters you have typed,
 Mahogany will automatically replace them with the corresponding full e-mail
 address.
 Other possible cases: either there are no matches at all and a message
 in the status line of the window will tell you so, or there are more than
 one match in which case you will be presented with a choice of all possible
 completions.
 
\layout Standard


\emph on 
Hint: 
\emph default 
if you press <TAB> immediately after the address expansion it will bring
 you to the next text entry zone and will not attempt the address expansion
 the second time.
\layout Standard

A special feature of the address expansion is the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

group extension
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

: if you type the first few letters of an address group name (see 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Address Book Editor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 description for more about it) it will be replaced by the addresses of
 all the addresses in this group.
 So, for example, if you have a group called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Friends
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 you may type 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

To:
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 text entry zone and after pressing <TAB> it will be replaced by the e-mail
 addresses of all your friends.
\layout Subsection

The Mail Composition Window_2100_
\layout Standard


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{MailCompositionWindow}

\end_inset 

The composition window's appearance depends on your configuration settings
 (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{ComposePage}

\end_inset 

).
 Generally, it will at least show text entry fields to specify who to send
 the message to, for the subject and a large editing window below for the
 actual message itself.
 It also features an EXPAND button next to the address field, which allows
 you to lookup addresses in the currently loaded addressbooks.
 If you type in the beginning or a substring of a name, alias or email address
 and either press the expand button or the tabulator key, Mahogany will
 look up a list of matching addressbook entries and either expand it directly
 or prompt you with the matching choices.
 This works for the main address field (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

To
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

) as well as for the carbon copy addresses (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

CC
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

BCC
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

).
 If you specify an address in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

CC
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

BCC
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 fields, these people will receive a copy of the message.
 The difference between them is that the list of addresses in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

CC
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is included in the message, while the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

BCC
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 (blind carbon copy) addresses will be suppresed in the message keeping
 them anonymous.
 If you enter an address like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

#myfolder
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, Mahogany will interpret it as the name of a mailfolder and save a copy
 of the message to that folder (in this case 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

myfolder
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

).
 
\layout Subsection

The News Article Composition Window_2101_
\layout Standard

This window is essentially identical to the mail composition window (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{MailCompositionWindow}

\end_inset 

), but instead of specifying a mail address to send the message to, you
 can enter one or more newsgroups names (comma separated).
 The newsserver used depends on from where this window was opened, if it
 was opened while reading a specific newgroup, it will use the same newsserver
 that the newsgroup was read from, otherwise it will fall back to the setting
 in the global preferences.
\layout Section

Understanding program options
\layout Standard

One of the goals of the Mahogany project is to be as configurably as possible.
 Of course, it means that Mahogany has a lot of options - however we hope
 that it doesn't make the program more difficult to use because you have
 the complete liberty to ignore all options until you need to use them.
 Moreover, some program options are completely transparent to the user because
 they are automatically remembered by the program.
 All the other ones may be changed from the main options dialog which may
 be invoked from the main window toolbar or from the menu.
 Generally, Mahogany configuration settings are inherited in a logical fashion.
 The settings in the preferences dialog are the global default settings
 and can be overridden on a per-folder basis.
 Subfolders inherit from their parent folders.
 Currently there is no full GUI support for this, but the next release will
 have the full set of program options available on the per-folder basis.
 Currently you can already achieve this by editing the configuration file
 manually.
 Also, system administrators can provide other defaults in a global /etc/Mahogan
y.conf file (also found in /usr/etc, /usr/local/etc, /opt/etc, ...).
\layout Subsection

Automatically remembered options
\layout Standard

These options include the sizes and the positions of all windows, the texts
 of all prompts, the positions of splitters in the main program window and
 the other folder views as well as several other things.
 These options are special in that they do not appear in the options dialog
 and so can not be changed directly - instead Mahogany remembers them each
 time it is shut down, so when it is reopened it will be in exactly the
 same state as during the last run.
 Try to play with it: adjust the sizes of the main program window and the
 splitters in it as you like, exit Mahogany and restart it (this is for
 testing only, of course, you do not need to do it each time!) - you should
 see that the window reappears on the same position (although this might
 not work under some window managers), has the same size and is split in
 the same manner.
\layout Subsection

Other options
\layout Standard

All other options except those mentioned in the previous subsection can
 be changed from the program options dialog.
 This dialog has several pages which are described in more details below:
\layout Subsubsection

TCP Timeout Values
\series default 

\newline 
These timeouts are used for all accesses to remote servers.
 Generally it is a good idea to set them to small values to avoid unnecessary
 delays if something goes wrong.
 On the other hand, you want to make sure that they are long enough for
 slow connections, like for example through a modem line.
 If you get a lot of error messages about failed accesses to remote servers,
 you should try to increase these settings.
\begin_deeper

This setting decides after how many seconds the attempt to open a connection
 to a remote mail or newsserver will time out.
 I.e.
 if no connection can be made within this time interval, the request will
 fail.
\layout Itemize

XFaces are small black and white bitmaps which can be added to the message
 header to identify the sender.
 Mahogany will recognise and display them if enabled.
 It will also attempt to load your XFace from the file specified and send
 it with messages you write.
 If you do not have your own XFace file, Mahogany will use its own default

 (a folder may become dead if, for example, the remote server goes down
 or the network link fails).
\layout Itemize


\series bold 
Automatically select first message in viewer
\series default 

\newline 
If enabled, Mahogany will automatically select and display the first message
 in the message viewer whenever you open a folder.
 This can be inconvenient if you want to just look at headers without downloadin
g messages over a slow link.
\layout Itemize


\series bold 
Threshold for displaying progress dialog
\series default 

\newline 
Mahogany will display progress dialogs when parsing mail folders or querying
 servers.
 If the number of messages is less than this threshold value, the progress

Preview message when selected
\newline 

\series default 
 When this option is set, any message that gets selected in the list of
 messages will get pre-viewed automatically.
 If using a modem connection, it makes sense to disable it, so messages
 will only get loaded and pre-viewed when double-clicked upon or when the
 'V' key is pressed.
 By default, this is enabled, so that clicking on a message or pressing
 the spacebar to select it, will also pre-view it.
\layout Itemize


\series bold 
Font family, font size, foreground colour, background colour, colour for
 URLs, colour for header names, colour for header values
\series default 

\newline 
These settings control the appearance of messages in the message viewer

 Mahogany will detect URLs embedded in messages and by using a different
 colour for them, can highlight them.
 When the user clicks on a URL, it will be opened in an external browser.
\layout Itemize


\series bold

Conversion graphics format
\series default 

\newline 
Mahogany uses an external conversion program (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{HelpersPage}

\end_inset 

) for image formats which it does not support natively.
 Here you can chose one of the natively supported formats to use for the
 conversion.
 At present, the most reliable format appears to be XPM.
 If configured properly and all libraries are available, Mahogany should
 support XPM, PNG, JPEG and BMP.
 Notice that XPM files are extremely large, so you might want to change
 this setting to one of the other formats.
 
\layout Itemize


\series bold

This enables support for domains sending faxes by email, such as the 
\latex latex

Domains sending faxes
\series default 

\newline 
This is a colon-separated list of domains sending faxes.
 All IMAGE/TIFF or APPLICATION/OCTET-STREAM MIME content in mails coming
 from these domains will be treated as TIFF-G3 faxes.
 Note that the strings in this field do not need to be real domain names
 but are substrings looked for in the sender's email address.
\layout Itemize


\series bold 
Maximum size of message
\series default 

\newline 
If you attempt to view a message larger than this limit, Mahogany will prompt
 you for confirmation.
 This is to prevent you from accidentally downloading large messages over
 a slow remote connection.
 Setting it to 0 will disable this.
 The limit is not applied to mailfolder files.
\layout Itemize


\series bold 
Maximum number of messages
\series default 

\newline 
If you open a folder with more than this limit of messages, Mahogany will
 ask you whether you want to limit the amount of messages downloaded (or
 partially downloaded).
 Again, this is to prevent you from accidentally downloading huge numbers
 of messages over a slow remote connection.
 Setting it to 0 disables this.
 It does not apply to mailfolder files.
 Also, for NNTP connections, this might be triggered although there could
 be less messages in the newsgroup, as at the time of testing the number
 of unread messages is not know yet.

 is about to be autocollected.
\layout Itemize


\series bold 
Address book to use
\series default 

\newline 
You may enter the path of the address book to use for autocollected addresses.
 Although you may use any address book for this, it is probably better to
 have a special address book for all autocollected addresses.
 If the path name given here is an absolute one, it is used as is.
 Otherwise, it is considered to be relative to your Mahogany directory.
 For example, the default for this option is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

autocollect.adb
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and so the default autocollect book will be created in 
\noun on

\layout Itemize


\series bold 
Ignore addresses without names
\series default 

\newline 
You may with to autocollect only addresses which have a full name - in this
 case you should check this option.
 If it is off and the address has no name, the first part of e-mail address
 (the one preceding the '@' symbol) will be used instead of the name.
\layout Standard

In addition to its own built-in addressbook format, Mahogany also supports
 the addressbook files of the BBDB addressbook used with Emacs (see 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{BBDB}

\end_inset 

).
 Some settings can be set here which apply only to the BBDB addressbook
 support:
\layout Itemize


\series bold 
Ignore entries without names
\series default 

\newline 
BBDB can store entries which have only an e-mail address with them, but
 no name.
 If you set this option, Mahogany will discard such entries.
\layout Itemize


\series bold 
Generate unique aliases
\series default 

\newline 
Setting this option allows Mahogany to ensure that all aliases are unique.
 If two entries have the same alias, one of them will be modified to distinguish
 them.
 This is especially useful in conjuction with the following option.
 If this option is set, reading in of BBDB addressbooks is slowed down considera
bly.
 However, setting it once, then saving the addressbook and disabling it,
 will make sure that all aliases are unique without slowing down subsequent
 loading of the addressbook the next time it is used.
\layout Itemize


\series bold 
Name for nameless entries
\series default 

\newline 
If Mahogany finds entries without a name and is not set to ignore it, this
 name will be used for such entries.
 It can be combined with the option to generate unique aliases.
\layout Itemize


\series bold 
Save on exit
\series default 

\newline 
As saving BBDB addressbook can potentially lead to some loss of information
 in the original database file (BBDB and Mahogany support different fields),
 you can choose whether you want Mahogany to automatically save the data
 on exit or ask you for confirmation.

\layout Subsection

Introduction
\layout Standard

Mahogany has a built-in address book system with flexible support for different
 addressbook formats.
 It can easily expanded to handle other programs' file formats and at present
 supports two formats, it's own ADB format (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{ADB}

\end_inset 

) and (X)Emacs' BBDB (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{ADB}

\end_inset 

) address book format.
 Generally the address books are ordered hierarchical, with the possibility
 to order entries in groups and sub-groups in a tree-like fashion.
 Alias expansion is configurable and also handles group names, to expand
 to the full list of email addresses within that given group.
\layout Subsection

The native Address Book _3001_
\layout Standard


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{ADB}

\end_inset 

This is Mahogany's own address book format, offering you the maximum set
 of functionality supported by the address book editor.
 It offers hierarchical grouping of address entries and it also the default
 address book format used by the address auto-collection mechanisms, which
 uses different groups for address entries collected from different mail
 folders.
\layout Standard

To edit the address book, open the address book editor.
 If the book is already present in the address book tree on the left side
 of the window, you may expand it (and any subgroups it might have) and
 start editing immediately.
 If not, you must first add it to the tree by choosing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

New..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 from the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Book
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 submenu or using the corresponding toolbar button.
\layout Standard

Generally speaking, there are several ways to perform the same action in
 the address book editor:
\layout Enumerate

use the menus: the commands for creating and deleting address book entries
 are in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Edit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 menu, the corresponding commands for the address books - in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Book
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 one.
\layout Enumerate

use the toolbar: this may be more convenient because, depending on the current
 position of the selected item in the tree it will propose to create either
 an address book or an entry.
\layout Enumerate

use keyboard: <INSERT> key creates a new entry or address book if the current
 selection is the root of the tree, <DELETE> deletes an item and <Alt-ENTER>
 brings upthe 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Properties
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 dialog.
\layout Standard

To edit the entry, simply select it in the tree.
 The data associated to it is spraed over several notebook pages - select
 the one which contains the field you want to change and change it.
 If you want to undo your changes, simply press 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Cancel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 at any moment - however, this only works while you're editing the entry.
 As soon as you pass to another one, all previous changes are saved and
 cannot be undone any more.
 The changes are saved automatically when you select another entry or close
 the address book editor - there is no special 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Save
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 button.
\layout Standard

To quickly move in the address book tree you may use either the

Support for BBDB Address Books_3002_
\layout Standard


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{BBDB}

\end_inset 

Mahogany supports reading and writing of BBDB address book files.
 BBDB is the Big Brother DataBase used with the Emacs family of editors.
 If you have an existing address book file, usually called 
\family typewriter 
.bbdb
\family default 
, you can load it into Mahogany and use it.
 This is especially useful if you have an existing file with auto-collected
 email addresses that you want to continue to use.
\layout Paragraph

Caution:
\layout Standard

The BBDB address book format supports different fields than Mahogany's native
 database.
 When reading a BBDB file, Mahogany will only read the first two addresses
 and telephone numbers and assign them to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Home
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Work
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 addresses and phone numbers.
 All additional addresses and phone numbers, the AKA list and the comments
 will get lost.
 Mahogany will only save the information displayed in the address editor
 window.
 Currently saving of phone numbers to BBDB files is unsupported as it uses
 a different format from Mahogany.
 
\shape italic 
Therefore, reading a BBDB file and saving it back to disk may lead to a
 loss of information!

Scripting and Extending 
\shape slanted 
Mahogany
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{Scripting}

\end_inset 


\layout Section

Introduction
\layout Standard


\shape slanted 
Mahogany 
\shape default 
has an embedded Python interpreter, if compiled with Python support enabled.
 Python is an object-oriented script language which can be used to write
 scripts to be executed by 
\shape slanted 
Mahogany
\shape default 
 or even to extend 
\shape slanted 
Mahogany
\shape default 
's functionality.
 Python scripts have full access to all internal Mahogany data structures
 and objects.Scripting and Python integration A number of user definable
 callback functions are available.
 Scripts have access most objects living in Mahogany.
 Scripting can be disabled in the Preferences dialog (see 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{PythonOptions}

\end_inset 

).
\layout Standard

Currently the scripting support is quite basic.
 If you are interested in writing scripts and need additional callbacks
 or support for them within 
\shape slanted 
Mahogany
\shape default 
, please get in touch with the developers who will be happy to add it.
\layout Section

Initialisation 
\layout Standard

At startup, 
\shape slanted 
Mahogany
\shape default 
 will load a file called 
\family typewriter 
Minit.py
\family default 
 and call the 
\family typewriter 
Minit()
\family default 
 function defined in there, without any arguments.
\layout Section

Callback Functions (Hooks)
\layout Standard

There are a number of callbacks available which will be called from different
 places within 
\shape slanted 
Mahogany
\shape default 
.
 These are defined in the header file 
\family typewriter 
Mcallbacks.h
\family default 
.
 The documentation of these callbacks can be found in the Classes documentation(
\latex latex 

\backslash 
htmladdnormallinkfoot{Classes online docs}{classes/index.html}
\latex default 
).
 All of these callbacks are called with at least two arguments:
\layout Enumerate

The name of the hook for which the function got called, e.g.
 
\family typewriter 
FolderOpenHook
\layout Enumerate

A pointer to the object from which it was called.
 E.g.
 for 
\family typewriter 
FolderOpenHook
\family default 
, this would be a pointer to a 
\family typewriter 
MailFolder
\family default 
 object.
 This object does not carry a useable type with it and needs to be converted
 in the callback, e.g.
 if the argument is called 
\family typewriter 
arg
\family default 
 and the object is a 
\family typewriter 
MailFolder
\family default 
, the object must either be used as 
\family typewriter 
MailFolder.MailFolder(arg)
\family default 
 or be converted as 
\family typewriter 
mf = MailFolder.MailFolder(arg)
\family default 
.
 
\layout Enumerate

Some callbacks have a third argument.
 This is either a single value or a tuple holding several values.
\layout Section

Namespaces
\layout Standard

To avoid repeatedly typing in the name of the module (
\family typewriter 
MailFolder
\family default 
 in this case), it can be imported into the global namespace with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
from
\protected_separator 
MailFolder
\protected_separator 
import
\protected_separator 
*
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 By default modules are not imported into the global namespace and must
 be explicitly named.

\layout Standard

Being a brand new program, this section is currently pretty empty.
 However, we will constantly update this chapter with questions received
 on the mailing lists.
\layout Section

Installation Problems
\layout Subsection

All Mahogany icons show a questionmark
\layout Standard


\shape italic 
I'm a linuxuser (redhat) who just found Mahogany and really likes it, but
 I have a problem, I cant get all the widgets to work, the pictures on the
 buttons and the ones before the mailboxes all appear as an questionmark.
 Do I need some library to make it look like your screenshot? If you would
 assist me in this matter I would be very greatful.
\layout Standard

It depends how you installed it.
 If the icon with the questionmark appears, it means that Mahogany didn't
 find its installation directory with the icons.
 If you installed the linux version from the .tar.gz with the binary, it should
 go into /usr/local or a similar place and you should have the icons in
 /usr/local/share/M/icons.
 If they are not there, Mahogany cannot find them.
 If you have installed it in a different location, Mahogany should ask you
 for the installation ("global Mahogany directory") when you start it for
 the first time.
\layout Standard

If you have compiled it yourself, make sure you do a "make install" or "make
 install_all" (of which parts might fail, depending on your setup), to install
 everything in the right place.
 If you just grabbed the binary of the daily snapshot, you need to have
 a working Mahogany installation as well or it won't get the icons.
 You do not need any additional library, Mahogany handles xpm files internally.
\layout Subsection

How do I unpack the compressed files?
\layout Standard

The distribution files for Solaris and some of the other ones, are in compressed
 tar format, having the ending 
\family typewriter 
.tar.gz
\family default 
 .
 To unpack them, you need 
\family typewriter 
gzip
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 
tar
\family default 
.
 Change to the directory where you want to install Mahogany, e.g to 
\family typewriter 
/usr
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 
/opt
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 
/usr/local
\family default 
 and issue the following command: 
\layout Quote


\family typewriter 
gzip -dc < thedistributionfile | tar xvof -
\layout Standard

Where 
\family typewriter 
thedistributionfile
\family default 
 is the complete path to the file you downloaded.
 You will need to have proper write access to the directory where you install
 it and 
\family typewriter 
tar
\family default 
 should show you a list of all files being installed as it unpacks them.
\layout Subsection

Compiling aborts with errors
\layout Standard


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{CompileErrors}

\end_inset 

A common problem with compiling wxGTK and Mahogany is, that you need to
 follow the instructions in Mahogany's README file and use the configure
 script to set them up as explained.
 If you use different arguments for configure than those shown in README,
 things will not work! Also, before running configure again, remove any
 *.cache and *status files in the working directory or configure will re-use
 some old settings.
\layout Standard

Also, as we are omitting some unused subdirectories from the wxGTK source,
 to save you download time, you may need to run 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

make -k
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 rather than just 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

make
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 to get it to ignore some errors caused by this.
 On non-Linux/GNU systems, you need to use the GNU linker, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

gmake
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 rather than the default 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

make
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
\layout Section

Other Problems
\layout Subsection

The Preferences Dialog does not show up properly
\layout Standard


\shape italic 
When I set up Mahogany or select the preferences dialog, its contents do
 not appear.
 Sometimes I cannot enter anything in the fields.
\layout Standard

wxGTK has a problem with constraint handling which can cause this dialog
 to sometimes get into an endless loop trying to do the layout.
 On most windowmanagers it helps if you resize the dialog a little and it
 will appear correctly.
 This seems to depend on the platform and windowmanager.
 Also, wxGTK does not seem to work correctly with OpenLook which does not
 allow you to enter anything.
\layout Subsection

How do I access mail downloaded via fetchpop/procmail?
\layout Standard


\shape italic 
I use fetchpop and procmail do deliver my mail (Redhat Linux).
 I'm reading mail with Netscape right now and I want to move to M.
 I cannot for the life of me get M to open my files when it loads.
 I have to open them manually.
 Can someone please help me (if its possible) to get M to open all of my
 Linux Folders at startup.
\layout Standard

You should be able to right-click on the folder treecontrol on the left
 of the main screen and "Create a new folder".
 Make it of type "file" and specify the path to the the folder file as the
 filename.
 Your normal mailspool /var/spool/mail/username is available under the name
 INBOX anyway, but I guess you have fetchpop/procmail deliver your mail
 to some other place.
\layout Subsection

Mahogany cannot create some files when run as root
\layout Standard

Mahogany will not work properly when executed by the 
\family typewriter 
root
\family default 
 super-user.
 The underlying mail handling library used in Mahogany will change to some
 other user id for security reasons and therefore the program will not be
 able to create some files needed.
 For security reasons it is a bad idea anyway to run any X11 application
 as 
\family typewriter 
root
\family default 
.
\layout Subsection

Does Mahogany have group aliases?
\layout Standard

Mahogany supports alias expansion for individual entries and for groups.
 There are two ways in which you can expand an alias to a group of addresses:
\layout Itemize

The quick and dirty approach: Create an addressbook entry and simply list
 multiple, comma separated, addresses in its Email field.
 Mahogany will use the whole contents of this field when expanding aliases.
 
\layout Itemize

The more elegan method: Create a new group in your addressbook and add the
 individual addresses as sub-entries of this group.
 If you use the group name as a mail alias, Mahogany will expand it to the
 list of email addresses of all of its group members.
 This is more powerful, as you can easily add and remove entries to sub
 groups.
\layout Subsection

How can I set up my POP3 access (applies to IMAP, too)?
\layout Standard


\shape italic 
It is not immediately apparent how to set up my POP3 server under 0.23a ,
 can someone give me a hand, please? It appears there is no section in the
 initial configuration utility for this.
 
\layout Standard

Mahogany allows you to have as many folders or mail accounts as you like.
 That's why it doesn't ask you at the beginning.
 To add a POP account: 
\layout Enumerate

right click on the folder tree and choose "Create Folder" 
\layout Enumerate

give the folder a name, set its type to POP and fill in the required fields,
 such as server and login 
\layout Enumerate

Click on [OK].
 The folder will now appear in the tree 
\layout Enumerate

Double-click on the folder to open it.
\layout Itemize

If opening fails, right click on it again and choose "Properties", make
 sure that all settings are correct.
 I found that occasionally some setting would not get set properly in the
 Windows version.
 Setting it again fixes it.
\layout Itemize

- If you want Mahogany to collect all mail from that box, you can tick that
 checkbox and whenever Mahogany starts, it will open that box and continue
 collecting all mail from there and move it to the "New Mail" folder.
\layout Subsection

Can I have multiple POP or IMAP accounts?
\layout Standard


\shape italic 
Can I access multiple different POP3 or IMAP accounts?
\layout Standard

Yes, 
\shape italic 
Mahogany
\shape default 
 allows you to have any number of different folders configured.
 Just right-click on the folder tree control and choose the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Create Folder...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
