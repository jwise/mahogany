Known issues with release 0.23a (pre-alpha)
===========================================

(see also readme_win.txt for Windows-specific problems)

Missing/not fully implemented features:
-----------------------------------

1. Many "standard" features are still lacking in this pre-alpha release, such
   as sorting. threading, scoring of messages; filters; newsgroup subscription
   support &c. Almost all of them are scheduled for implementation in the next
   release.

2. Some of the settings are not yet configurable on per-folder basis - this
   will be changed a.s.a.p.

Bugs:
-----

1. Choosing "Cancel" from the options dialog sometimes doesn't remember the
   old values, i.e., although it seems to work, the settings will be wrong the
   next time the program is run.

2. When retrieving messages from a newsgroup which has more than the
   specified threshold of messages in total, but less of unread/new messages
   than the threshold, you will still be asked about retrieving only the last
   <N> messages (this question is unnecessary in this case)

UI glitches:
------------

1. No keyboard accelerators - yet.

2. Compose screen sometimes doesn't refresh (especially when scrolling fast),
   clicking it with a mouse usually corrects the problem.

3. Windows icons are ugly.

4. [Expand] button in "Post newsgroup article" window does nothing and
   shouldn't be there at all.
