Known issues with release 0.01 (pre-alpha)
==========================================

Missing/badly implemented features:
-----------------------------------

1. Windows python support doesn't work well, unless you have complete Python distribution
   installed (and perhaps even then), especially with Windows 95 (not NT)

2. NNTP support is not really usable

Bugs:
-----

1. Compose view sometimes doesn't get updated until the next key press

2. Problems with using non-english characters have been reported (but I couldn't
   reproduce them yet)

UI glitches:
------------

1. Closing the application doesn't prompt to save the changes in the compose window

2. Keyboard interface in compose view is half working (and half broken)

3. In general, compose screen lacks many features, such as positioning the cursor,
   selecting (either with the mouse or keyboard), clipboard support &c -- all this
   will be implemented in near future
