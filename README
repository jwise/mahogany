Issues with the current release
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Mahogany now compiles with gtk 1.2.1, however the underlying wxGTK
toolkit still exhibits a few minor bugs:
   - with gtk 1.2.1: Preferences dialogs layout is corrupted, but 
                     resizing them corrects the layout, labels
                     are centred.
   - with gtk 1.0.6: Occasionally (depending on the windowmanager),
                     dialogs flicker and resize themselves to the
                     minimal size of approx. 1x1 pixels. All you can
                     do in that situation is to either press a key to
                     select it or close it manually.

   Depending on how soon these two problems get fixed, we will relink
   the current release of Mahogany with wxGTK and re-release it.
   The next release is planned for the end of May/first week of June
   and will be for Unix and Windows.

More detailed information about Mahogany, how to get support for it,
how to contribute it, and last not least, how to use it, can be found
in the user manual, included in HTML and PostScript format, or the
online help system. Some quick compilation notes can be found below,
more in the manual.

Be not confused by references to a program called "M", that was the
original working title for "Mahogany".

Compilation notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------

These are some very brief notes about how to compile M.
More detailed, step for step, instructions can be found in the Manual,
which is contained in the Mdoc.tar.gz file in the doc directory.
You can also view it online at http://www.phy.hw.ac.uk/~karsten/M/dl/Manual/

To install:
  ./configure --help
  ./configure "with your appropriate options"
  make depend
  make             # or "make all" to try to build message catalogs as well
  make doc
  make install_all

  Depending on whether you have installed all required programs in the
  right versions, "make doc" and "make install_all" might
  fail. Instead, you can do the following:
    make install         # this will install the program and required files
    make install_doc     # this should install the documentation and online help
    make install_locale  # this tries to build and install the message catalogs

Required software:

   - wxGTK, the gtk port of wxWindows
	available from http://web.ukonline.co.uk/julian.smart/wxwin/
        M is not based on any of the earlier betas, but on a snapshot
        from the cvs. If you want to make sure that you don't have any 
        problems in compiling and linking M against it, you should
        download the wxGTK snapshot used by us to compile the binary release
	of Mahogany. It is available from:
	http://www.phy.hw.ac.uk/~karsten/M/dl/wxGTK.tar.gz

   - libgtk 1.0.x, libglib 1.0.x, or gtk/glib 1.2.x


- wxGTK should be configured with the following options:
    ./configure \
    --with-gtk \
    --with-static \
    --without-shared \
    --with-dmalloc \
    --without-odbc \
    --with-threads \
    --with-libpng \
    --with-libjpeg 

If using gtk 1.0.6 rather than 1.2.x, youu need to add --without-dnd .
If you experience a problem with thread support, you can just as well
compile it --without-threads, they are not currently required.
