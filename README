README file for Mahogany 0.66 "Clio"
====================================================================

Welcome to Mahogany and thank you for using it!

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Important information
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Please read the "Internet resources" section to find how to contact
us.

Please read the "Troubleshooting" section before reporting the bugs.

Don't be confused by references to a program called "M", which was
the original working title for "Mahogany".

Please note that in places where this file contradicts the manual,
the information here should be considered correct.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation and building instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------

a) Windows users: please refer to the file doc/readme_win.txt
   for instructions about installing the provided Win32 binary.
   If you are interested in rebuilding the program from sources
   yourself, please see doc/build_win.txt (in addition to the
   previous file)

b) Unix users: the binary installation is dependent on your OS (or
   distribution) and so cannot be described here but it is not
   different from installing any other program. If we don't provide
   a binary exactly matching your system it is highly recommended
   that you rebuild the program from sources, please see INSTALL
   file for the instuctions.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
What's next?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

You should be able to run Mahogany by now. If you run it for the
first time, you will see the initial installation wizard which will
allow you to set the most basic options needed to use the program.
Please note that all of them can be changed later, in particular you
don't have to create any server using the wizard as you may add
them later as well.

If you completed the wizard successfully, you should now be able to
start using Mahogany. The next thing to do is probably to configure
it to suit your needs better - you will find a lot of possibilities
for this in the programs options dialog which is accessed via the
"Preferences..." item of the "Edit" menu.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
Troubleshooting
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Please post any questions you may have to the Mahogany users mailing
list. If you are reporting a bug, don't forget to specify the
version of Mahogany you are using and also the platform you are
running it under -- thank you in advance!

Also please turn on the "Debug server and mailbox access" option
found in the last page of the preferences dialog or run Mahogany
with "--debug" command line option if you experience any mail
related problems (e.g. receiving or sending mail doesn't work): this
will result in more verbose messages in the log window which can be
very helpful to diagnose the problem.
