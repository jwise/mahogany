README file for Mahogany, Release 0.60 "???"
--------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Issues with the current release
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Mahogany, just like wxGTK, works best with gtk+ 1.2.6.  gtk+ 1.2.7
might cause some minor problems. Please understand that this is not
a Mahogany-specific problem and that we cannot do anything about it.

More detailed information about Mahogany, how to get support for it,
how to contribute it, and last not least, how to use it, can be found
in the user manual, included in HTML and PostScript format, or the
online help system. Some quick compilation notes can be found below,
more in the manual. All the information, including the full online
docs, are also available on the Mahogany web page:
http://mahogany.sourceforge.net/

Be not confused by references to a program called "M", which was the
original working title for "Mahogany".

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Required software
--------------------------------------------------------------------

   - wxGTK, the gtk port of wxWindows
   - libgtk 1.2.x, libglib 1.2.x

If you want to compile Mahogany with SSL support, you must have OpenSSL
installed first. Then you can configure Mahogany with the additional
option --with-ssl.

Compilation notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------

These are some very brief notes about how to compile Mahogany.  More
detailed step-for-step instructions can be found in the Manual, which
is contained in the Mdoc.tar.gz file in the doc directory.  You can
also view it online at http://mahogany.sourceforge.net/

Before you can compile Mahogany, you will need to have installed
wxWindows compiled for the GTK library (wxGTK).

- wxWindows should be configured with the following option:
     ./configure --with-gtk

  If you experience compilation problems, add the option
  --disable-optimise     # this is also needed for gcc 2.8.0

Doing a "make" and "make install" in the wxWindows directory should
install the header files and libraries on your system.

- To compile and install Mahogany itself:
  ./configure --help
  cd /some/build/dir
  sh /the/source/dir/configure "with your appropriate options"
  make    # or "make all" to try to build message catalogs as well
  make doc
  make install

  If you built wxWindows with debug enabled, specify the --with-debug
  option when configuring Mahogany.

  Depending on whether you have installed all required programs in the
  right versions, "make doc" and "make install" might
  fail. Instead, you can do the following:
    make install_bin     # this will install the program and other
                         # required files
    make install_locale  # this tries to build and install the message
                         # catalogs
    make install_doc     # this should install the documentation and
                         # online help

Also, if you change into the src directory, the additional targets
"make static" and "make semistatic" are available, to produce binaries
with less dependencies on external libraries.
