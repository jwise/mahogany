Preliminary README file for M.

To install:
  ./configure --help
  ./configure "with your appropriate options"
  make depend
  make             # or "make all" to try to build message catalogs as well
  make doc
  make install_all

  Depending on whether you have installed all required programs in the
  right versions, "make doc" and "make install_all" might
  fail. Instead, you can do the following:
    make install         # this will install the program and required files
    make install_doc     # this should install the documentation and online help
    make install_locale  # this tries to build and install the message catalogs

  If the generation of the docs fails (likely!), you can get the file
  Mdoc.tar.gz from http://www.phy.hw.ac.uk/~karsten/M/dl/
  and either unpack it directly in the .../share/M/doc/ directory
  (.. is wherever M gets installed, e.g. /usr/local) or copy it to the
  doc directory in the source tree and run "make install" in there.

  To rebuild only from the M source, without recompiling the extra
  libraries, run make from the M/src sub-directory.

Required software:

   - wxGTK, the gtk port of wxWindows
	available from http://web.ukonline.co.uk/julian.smart/wxwin/
        M is not based on any of the earlier betas, but on a snapshot
        from the cvs. If you want to make sure that you don't have any 
        problems in compiling and linking M against it, you should
        download the wxGTK snapshot used by us to compile the binary release
	of M. It is available from:
	http://www.phy.hw.ac.uk/~karsten/M/dl/wxGTK.tar.gz
	We have configured wxGTK for the build as follows:
	./configure --with-gtk --without-odbc --without-tooltips
                    --with-debug_flag --with-debug_info
	After running configure in the wxWindows directory, change to
        the src sub-directory and run "make" and "make install".

   - libgtk 1.0.x, libglib 1.0.x, wxGTK does not work with gtk-1.1 (yet)

   For regenerating the documentation only (can be avoided by using
   Mdoc.tar.gz as explained above):
   - doc++ for generating the class documentation
     Alternatively the Makefile system will try to use kdoc or scandoc
     (included), but might fail halfway during class documentation generation.
   - latex, latex2html, netpbm and plenty of disk space on /tmp for
     generating the online docs
