in the user manual, included in HTML and PostScript format, or the
online help system. Some quick compilation notes can be found below,
more in the manual. All the information, including the full online
docs, are also available on the Mahogany web page:

Compilation notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------

These are some very brief notes about how to compile Mahogany.  More
detailed step-for-step instructions can be found in the Manual, which
is contained in the Mdoc.tar.gz file in the doc directory.  You can
also view it online at http://mahogany.sourceforge.net/docs.html

Required software

   - wxGTK (GTK port of wxWindows) 2.2.1 or above, 2.2.7 recommended
     (2.3.0 is also known to work)
   - GTK+ 1.2.3 or above, 1.2.10 recommended

If you want to compile Mahogany with SSL support, you must have OpenSSL
installed first. Then you can configure Mahogany with the additional
option --with-ssl.

Before you can compile Mahogany, you will need to have installed
wxWindows compiled for the GTK library (wxGTK).

- wxWindows should be configured with the following option:
     ./configure --with-gtk

Doing a "make" and "make install" in the wxWindows directory should
install the header files and libraries on your system.

- To compile and install Mahogany itself:
  ./configure --help
  cd /some/build/dir
  sh /the/source/dir/configure "with your appropriate options"
  make    # or "make all" to try to build message catalogs as well
  make doc
  make install

  Depending on whether you have installed all required programs in the
  right versions, "make doc" and "make install" might
  fail. Instead, you can do the following:
    make install_bin     # this will install the program and other
                         # required files
    make install_locale  # this tries to build and install the message
                         # catalogs
    make install_doc     # this should install the documentation and
                         # online help

Also, if you change into the src directory, the additional targets
"make static" and "make semistatic" are available, to produce binaries
with less dependencies on external libraries.

If you built wxWindows with debug enabled, specify the --with-debug
and  --with-wxdebug options when configuring Mahogany.

If you want AvantGo/MAL synchronisation for the PalmOS module, you will
need to get the libmal.tar.gz library source from the mahogany ftp server
and unpack it in the extra/src directory.
