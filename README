README file for Mahogany, Release 0.50 "Meadows"
--------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Issues with the current release
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Mahogany, just like wxGTK, works best with gtk+ 1.2.6. 
gtk+ 1.2.7 might cause some minor problems. Please understand that
this is not a Mahogany specific problem and that we cannot do
anything about it. 

More detailed information about Mahogany, how to get support for it,
how to contribute it, and last not least, how to use it, can be found
in the user manual, included in HTML and PostScript format, or the
online help system. Some quick compilation notes can be found below,
more in the manual. All the information, including the full online
docs, are also available on the Mahogany web page:
http://mahogany.home.dhs.org/

Be not confused by references to a program called "M", which was the
original working title for "Mahogany".

Compilation notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------

These are some very brief notes about how to compile Mahogany.
More detailed, step for step, instructions can be found in the Manual,
which is contained in the Mdoc.tar.gz file in the doc directory.
You can also view it online at http://www.wxwindows.org/Mahogany/

Mahogany is known to work with wxGTK 2.1.14 and should work with 2.1.15
and 2.2.0 when they are officially released.

Before you can compile Mahogany, you will need to get a copy of wxGTK and
compile and install it.

- wxGTK should be configured with the following option:
     ./configure --with-gtk 

  If you experience compilation problems, add the option
  --disable-optimise     # this is also needed for gcc 2.8.0

Doing a "make" and "make install" in the wxWindows directory should install
the header files and libraries on your system. 

- To compile and install Mahogany itself:
  ./configure --help
  ./configure "with your appropriate options"
  make depend
  make             # or "make all" to try to build message catalogs as well
  make doc
  make install_all

  If you built wxWindows with debug enabled, specify the --with-debug option
  when configuring Mahogany. 

  Depending on whether you have installed all required programs in the
  right versions, "make doc" and "make install_all" might
  fail. Instead, you can do the following:
    make install         # this will install the program and required files
    make install_doc     # this should install the documentation and
                         # online help
    make install_locale  # this tries to build and install the message
                         # catalogs

Also, if you change into the src directory, the additional targets
"make static" and "make semistatic" are available, to produce binaries 
with less dependencies on external libraries.

Required software:

   - wxGTK, the gtk port of wxWindows
   - libgtk 1.2.x, libglib 1.2.x


If you want to compile Mahogany with SSL support, you need to have
OpenSSL installed first. Then you can configure Mahogany with the additional
option --with-ssl.
