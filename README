More detailed information about Mahogany, how to get support for it,
how to contribute it, and last not least, how to use it, can be
found in the user manual, included in HTML and PostScript format, or
the online help system. All the information, including the full
online documentation, are also available on the Mahogany web page:

                  http://mahogany.sourceforge.net/

Be not confused by references to a program called "M", which was the
original working title for "Mahogany".

0. Prerequisites
----------------

Required software:

   - wxGTK (GTK+ port of wxWindows) 2.3.2 or above
     (2.3.2 is the latest released version as of this writing)

   - GTK+ 1.2.3 or above, 1.2.10 recommended

   - GNU make: both wxWindows and Mahogany may be compiled with many
     different C++ compilers (i.e. not only g++) but they both
     require GNU make, please install it if you don't have it yet
     (it might be available as gmake on some systems)

In addition:

   - If you want to compile Mahogany with SSL support, you must also
     have OpenSSL libraries and headers, see http://www.openssl.org/.
     If you already have them installed but in a non-standard
     location where Mahogany doesn't find them, use --with-ssl=dir
     configure option.

   - If you want to compile Mahogany with Python support, you need
     Python libraries and headers installed. Python 1.5x, 2.0 and
     2.1 are currently supported. You should run configure with
     --with-python option as well.

   - To build with Palm support you need pisock library and headers.

   - To rebuild the documentation from sources you need Perl, LaTeX,
     makeindex, dvips, ps2pdf and latex2html - however you may just
     use the prebuilt documentation instead of installing all these
     tools if you don't have them, please see below

   - If you want AvantGo/MAL synchronisation for the PalmOS module,
     you will need to get the libmal.tar.gz library source from the
     Mahogany ftp server and unpack it in the extra/src directory.

1. Compilation
--------------

a) wxWindows

Before you can compile Mahogany, you will need to have installed
wxWindows compiled for the GTK library (wxGTK).

NOTE: there are unfortunately a few bugs in wxGTK 2.3.2 directly
      affecting Mahogany which were fixed immediately after 2.3.2
      release. If, by the time you are reading it, 2.3.3 is not
      released yet please download wxWindows source distribution
      from our download page instead of using the official 2.3.2
      release!

The recommended switches for wxWindows compilation are:

      ./configure --disable-threads --disable-joystick \
                  --no-recursion --with-gtk

(you may also use the usual --prefix switch, of course)

After running configure, do "make" (or "gmake" if your make is not the GNU
make) and "make install".

b) Mahogany

Mahogany uses the standard configure script as well, so the simplest
way to compile it is to just type "./configure && make && make
install".

The recommended way to build it is to do the following from the
Mahogany directory:

      mkdir build_dir   # name is arbitrary
      cd build_dir
      ../configure
      make    # or "make all" to try to build message catalogs as well
      make doc
      make install

Depending on whether you have installed all required programs in the
right versions, "make doc" and "make install" might fail. Please
download the file Mdocs-0.64.tar.gz from the SourceForge download
server and put it in the build_dir/doc directory, then retry.

If you don't want to install the documentation at all, you may do the
following:

    make install_bin     # this will install the program and other
                         # required files
    make install_locale  # this tries to build and install the message
                         # catalogs
    make install_doc     # this should install the documentation and
                         # online help

2. What's next?
---------------

You should be able to use Mahogany by now. The next thing to do is
probably to configure it to suit your needs better - you will find a
lot of possibilities for this in the programs options dialog which
is accessed via the "Preferences..." item of the "Edit" menu.

Please post any questions you may have to the Mahogany users mailing
list. If you are reporting a bug, don't forget to specify the
version of Mahogany you are using and also the platform you are
running it under - thank you in advance!

We hope you will enjoy Mahogany!
