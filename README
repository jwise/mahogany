Unix compilation instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Required software

   - wxGTK (GTK+ port of wxWindows) 2.3.2 or above
     (2.3.2 is the latest released version as of this writing)

   - GTK+ 1.2.3 or above, at leats 1.2.10 recommended

If you want to compile Mahogany with SSL support, you must also
have OpenSSL libraries and headers, see http://www.openssl.org/.

If you want to compile Mahogany with Python support, you need Python
libraries and headers installed. Python 1.5x, 2.0 and 2.1 is
currently supported.

- Before you can compile Mahogany, you will need to have installed
  wxWindows compiled for the GTK library (wxGTK).

  Please refer to wxWindows documentation for the detailed
  installation instructions. The simple "configure; make; make
  install" should work in most cases, be sure to specify
  "--with-gtk" configure switch when compiling on a commercial Unix
  system with Motif installed.

- To compile and install Mahogany itself:

     ./configure --help
     cd /some/build/dir
     sh /the/source/dir/configure "with your appropriate options"
     make    # or "make all" to try to build message catalogs as well
     make doc
     make install

  Depending on whether you have installed all required programs in the
  right versions, "make doc" and "make install" might
  fail. Instead, you can do the following:
    make install_bin     # this will install the program and other
                         # required files
    make install_locale  # this tries to build and install the message
                         # catalogs
    make install_doc     # this should install the documentation and
                         # online help

Also, if you change into the src directory, the additional targets
"make static" and "make semistatic" are available, to produce binaries
with less dependencies on external libraries.

If you built wxWindows with debug enabled, specify the --with-debug
and  --with-wxdebug options when configuring Mahogany.

If you want AvantGo/MAL synchronisation for the PalmOS module, you will
need to get the libmal.tar.gz library source from the mahogany ftp server
and unpack it in the extra/src directory.
