Preliminary README file for M.

These are some very brief notes about how to compile M.
More detailed, step for step, instructions can be found in the Manual,
which is contained in the Mdoc.tar.gz file in the doc directory.
You can also view it online at http://www.phy.hw.ac.uk/~karsten/M/dl/Manual/

To install:
  ./configure --help
  ./configure "with your appropriate options"
  make depend
  make             # or "make all" to try to build message catalogs as well
  make doc
  make install_all

  Depending on whether you have installed all required programs in the
  right versions, "make doc" and "make install_all" might
  fail. Instead, you can do the following:
    make install         # this will install the program and required files
    make install_doc     # this should install the documentation and online help
    make install_locale  # this tries to build and install the message catalogs

Required software:

   - wxGTK, the gtk port of wxWindows
	available from http://web.ukonline.co.uk/julian.smart/wxwin/
        M is not based on any of the earlier betas, but on a snapshot
        from the cvs. If you want to make sure that you don't have any 
        problems in compiling and linking M against it, you should
        download the wxGTK snapshot used by us to compile the binary release
	of M. It is available from:
	http://www.phy.hw.ac.uk/~karsten/M/dl/wxGTK.tar.gz

   - libgtk 1.0.x, libglib 1.0.x, wxGTK does not work with gtk-1.1 (yet)
