"This is the license under which all original source code developed "
"for <em>Mahogany</em> is licensed and distributed."
"<p>"
"It is not our intent to restrict other developers "
"in re-using our code and because of this we also allow licensing the "
"program under GPL license. Finally, if you feel that you want to do "
"something with the <em>Mahogany</em> source that neither of these "
"licenses permit, please get in touch with us."

"        <H4>Preamble</H4>"
"    The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which this"
"    software package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains"
"    some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,"
"    while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the"
"    Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable"
"    modifications."
"    <p>This license is based on Perl's ``Artistic"
"      License'' and has been adapted to better suit <i>Mahogany</i>. It aims to conform"
"      with the Open-Source specification."
